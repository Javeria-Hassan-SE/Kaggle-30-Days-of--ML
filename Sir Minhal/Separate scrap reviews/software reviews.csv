There seem to be only two modes on the Android app when the PLT Fit is connected via Bluetooth. One shows the Bluetooth icon but plays through the phone speakers.

I admit I'm a new user of the app, however I found I had accidentally engaged an annotation feature when trying to unmute (I guess buttons overlay slightly or something?). Pressing back in android *did not* simply return you to your active meeting but rather to app settings it seems like. Worse yet, pressing back button from this screen rather than returning you to your active meeting dumps you to home screen (not hanging up thankfully) rather than sending you back to your active meeting. To me this is rather insane. I had legitimate issues getting myself unmuted in time for my turn in my meeting. Eventually after I ran some where else to offer my thoughts, walking back I found that there was a return to meeting button on the primary screen of settings, but the back button functionality is extremely poorly thought out.",zoom

Google should probably scrub these useless reviews for people to find out how the app is rated for people who actually would use this.

Today we can see a message and not respond immediately because we are busy and for no other reason. But sometimes it's misinterpreted. This is one of the reasons why I like hangouts more than other messaging platforms.",google meet
Chhaya,Best video quality ,"Google Hangouts helped me and continues to help me with my business to connect with my clients and colleagues, although it has many things that can be improved, it has everything necessary to communicate in addition, free of charge, unlimited and without the need to use other applications, much less install anything . It is a very good solution especially if you are a user of the entire Google ecosystem since, as expected, its integration is excellent.",google meet
Eddy,Google Meet Keeps you Connected,Without Google Hangouts I wouldn't have been able to successfully complete my tasks and responsibilities while working from home remotely. I highly recommend this tool for small companies that want to allow their employees the ability to telecommute.,google meet
Gustavo,A great tool that still needs improvement,"Hangout has helped my organization reduce spending on a previous collaboration software we hitherto used. I personally prefer hangout for my instant messaging activities. Not only is the software smooth and lightweight, but it is also very easy to use as well as been quick and unproblematic. It is the epitome of messaging convenience for me.",google meet
Mira,Useful for virtual meetings,"Our company has a very flexible work-from-home policy, which means that most of our meetings occur with someone joining via Hangouts. It's usually a very good experience, we share screen and work very much like we were sitting side by side. It's especially useful for working on a shared Google document, both reading and editing at the same time. We also use it with clients, who are increasingly adopting Google suite as their corporative tool for emails and documents. We've grown so used to this way of remote collaborations that we cringe when asked to use Skype and get office documents attached to emails.   I would definitely recommend Hangouts as a great tool for video meeting and collaboration, however I cannot vouch for it's performance with large quantity of attendants, we usually have no more than two or three people connecting remotely to Hangouts.  ",google meet
Brittany,Love it,"Hangouts definitely has a lot of potential and the fact it can be downloaded on your phone is amazing because a lot of people have issues sending texts between Apple and Android devices. Perhaps, instead of having the hangouts extension open up a mini tab for hangouts, have it take you to the old official site instead? I liked the old site a lot better than the extension window that pops up. Overall, Hangouts is a great communications tool and should be used more than it is by the common person. Highly underrated. ",google meet
Anant,Hangouts - What better way to work from home?,"Integration is the key selling point for using Hangouts. I like that I can access it from anywhere, can talk to people seamlessly through multiple devices, and have search features at my disposal.

We hold conferences and judging events where the presenter is unable to be there in person so using GoToMeeting, they are able to present their PowerPoints and interact with the audience in real  time almost as seamlessly as if they were there.

Meetings sometimes get delayed  due to someone having an audio or other connection issue but not often enough for it to be a big problem. One of the most valuable uses is for remote presentations. We hold conferences and judging events where the presenter is unable to be there in person so using GoToMeeting, they are able to present their PowerPoints and interact with the audience in real  time almost as seamlessly as if they were there. My biggest recommendation is to always test important meetings and presentations where time and presentation are important factors with the actual connections and computers that will be used at the time of the actual meeting.

Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too.   I will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while.",zoom
Anonymous,Highly suggested for healthcare professionals since it is HIPAA Compliant,"Right now, my company is moving all language classes to Zoom for the foreseeable future until further notice, in order to commit to social distancing during the coronavirus crisis within the Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan regions. Although we are still within the first two weeks of transition, it has been a smooth one overall and both teachers and students (as well as company administrators) seem pleased enough in spite of the vast differences between virtual learning and in-person classes.",zoom
Henry,Favorite software I use daily,"We have remote team members all over the World and we have a standup everyday. Using good video really does make the personal connection stronger and the team works better with a stronger human bond.  The Slack integration is great.

This takes an issue from email, tickets, and chatting to a shared video conference where we can share screens and see what people are looking at and get resolutions faster.",zoom
Bob,Zoom works the best out all the systems I have tried.,"For a period of time, I solely worked from home because I had young children. Zoom was a game changer for me!

Francisco,The best tool for conference and group calls,"Overall zoom is a great tool for meetings and webinar. People can also join without host joining the call. So, you don't have to wait till host's join. It's quick and the phone app works well to. I like the UI It's simple and easy to send an invite. We used to do all meeting including international ones with zoom only and if the internet is good, I never faced and drop or lags in the call. ",zoom
Leif,"Great conferencing software, couple annoyances","We are all able to share screens and see the same content together, at the same time. We do not have to email our spreadsheets or presentations before the meeting, constantly reminding everyone where to look or what we are discussing to stay on topic. We are able to see our team's faces for better communication, which leads to better understanding and interaction.",zoom
Anonymous,"It actually works smoothly, unlike its competition","Overall my experience with Zoom has been overwhelmingly positive. Once you get over the initial bumps in the road to figure out how to best use it, it shines as a software. I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing.",zoom
Andrew,Webconferencing for the agile workplace,"Zoom has been a great investment for us.  We have never had software or any tool so quickly adopted by our users.  By using Zoom, we have cut costs on video conferencing and allowed ourselves to do more with less in regards to conferencing.  It has become the go to collaboration tool, and more user are doing video conferencing/screen sharing than they ever did with another tool. ",zoom
David,A great alternative to GoToMeeting and WebEx,I am very happy with our choice to move to Zoom. It is not very resource intensive and is more cost effective than Webex. No additional 'Firewall work' was needed to get it going on our network and the interface is clean. The web admin console is easy to use and makes managing licenses a breeze. We are able to save on the amount of licenses needed as non licensed user still has 45 minutes of meeting time. Users are normally prompted very clearly about how soon the 45min time will elapse and it helps to wrap up meetings. I highly recommend Zoom for any size organization. ,zoom

It's got great video quality, and it works great on my devices.  I also like that there isn't this huge ordeal to use it's system.  It's got a great reputation, and almost all of the people I do business with know what Zoom is, and also already use it, so that makes it extremely easy on me as well! ",zoom
Kristin,Zoom Meetings and Chat Review,A great solution for calls with more than 2 parties. Screen sharing is easy to use and can be passed between attendees quickly and easily.

I think it's a brilliant piece of software.",zoom
Ahmet Fatih,No Latency Video Meeting with Robust Infrastructure,"I originally started using Zoom with a client who had a client out of state.

Kerry,"Steeper Learning Curve than Hangouts, But Better Results","Using Zoom was great especially for organizations that need to take HIPAA compliance into consideration. Since Zoom encrypts connections end to end, it works out great. It also was really easy to use their API, and it was very well documented. We rarely had issues with reliability through Zoom being used directly within our software. I thought it was very easy to use, and a much better option than most other video platforms. We also made great use of the reporting mechanism to know how much utilization we were getting out of Zoom. And the meetings that we generated across the organization, since we purchased an API subscription, were easy to customize for the settings on each meeting.   I do think generating meetings in Zoom is kind of inconvenient. There is a lot of information that must be copied and pasted into meeting invites and people often have questions about what link they should use. ",zoom

Even external clients with no experience using ZOOM can access it and use it with little issue. As with all products, the more people are comfortable with the tools that ZOOM provides, the greater collaboration can be. Once people understand this, they find ZOOM to be one of the best tools for their day-to-day and begin scheduling their own web conferences.

So far, this platform feels more like your team being in the same room together than other professional meeting platforms.",zoom

However, it currently does not include a very detailed gradebook. I have to keep separate spreadsheets with my students' grades in order to use weighted categories.",google class room
Alan Urbina,,"As stated before, Google Classroom would be well suited for an instructor that wants students to have access to a large portion of information related to the class. It may be less appropriate to use as a school-wide site.",google class room
Tamara Letter,,"Google classroom is well suited for a 3rd grade and up classroom. It is especially well suited for middle and high school where students are more well-versed in using technology. It allows teachers to easily share assignments with students and grade those assignments quickly and without paper. It might not be as useful in classrooms that do not have 1:1 technology, as it would be harder for students to finish assignments on time.",google class room
Rosemary Reynolds,,"Google Classroom is suitable for any classroom setting from grades 3 to the collegiate level. Students are easily and quickly engaged and can maintain communication with teachers beyond normal teaching hours. Students can submit their work and receive grades directly on the site, and they are able to share resources with others for group projects or other collaborative settings.",google class room
David LeNoble,,"I believe Google Classroom is well-suited for any classroom in education. It is great for posting announcements, assignments, and class material. It is also a great method of online learning when an in-class session is not possible (snow days, homework to be completed at home, etc.) It would be less appropriate in scenarios outside of education, although the means of communication are easy.",google class room
Liz Swarczewski,,"Google Classroom is best suited to a fixed group of users where everyone is a managed Google user within a G-Suite environment. We have an often transient group of learners, some of whom are not within our managed network of Google users. Therefore, our situation may not be ideal.",google class room
Carly McPartland,,"For classroom teachers, it is ACES. Even if an instructor is using it just as a repository for student work it's fantastic. Google Classroom can aid you in becoming a paperless classroom or just reducing some of the copies that you are making. If YouTube is blocked in your school, you can post links for students to view at home (or on their phones). Google classroom can help high school or college level teachers keep their learning environments ORGANIZED.",google class room

Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection.",gotomeeting

Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription.
