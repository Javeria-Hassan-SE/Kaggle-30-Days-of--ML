I have to use another phone Everytime for meeting. I am nougat now. Edit: Hi, i am not trying to listen to song while on the Gotomeeting session. I am saying that after joining and then disconnecting the Gotomeeting session, i am not able to speak or listen any sound from my phone. Even in the cellular call i am not able to hear anything. That's what my concern is. I have to restart my device and then i can place the listen to anything on phone normally. It all started when i tried to use sound recorder(in built phone application on Mi5) during a Gotomeeting session. After this incident Gotomeeting misbehaves everytime i join a session through app. Please suggest a solution.",gotomeeting,negative
