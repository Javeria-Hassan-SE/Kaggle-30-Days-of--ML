I admit I'm a new user of the app, however I found I had accidentally engaged an annotation feature when trying to unmute (I guess buttons overlay slightly or something?). Pressing back in android *did not* simply return you to your active meeting but rather to app settings it seems like. Worse yet, pressing back button from this screen rather than returning you to your active meeting dumps you to home screen (not hanging up thankfully) rather than sending you back to your active meeting. To me this is rather insane. I had legitimate issues getting myself unmuted in time for my turn in my meeting. Eventually after I ran some where else to offer my thoughts, walking back I found that there was a return to meeting button on the primary screen of settings, but the back button functionality is extremely poorly thought out.",4,12,4.1.35374.1217,2019-01-28 19:24:44,,,rating,us.zoom.videomeetings

Google Hangouts implements this without a whiteboard facility and with a limitations to interact with only 10 live participants. If Google classroom is a educational technology Google needs to provide a video conferencing capability within it, with at least 50 students, or a webinar capability with a larger group. Teachers needs to leave Google platforms to other sources for this requirements. I hope Google will implement such a facility soon.

However audio not so good. The problem is that there are no options to choose audio routing in the app. I'm using an Android One phone (Nokia 7.2) and I guess the assumption is that Android would correctly choose the routing when I plugged in headphones. However this did not happen on my device. So I ended up with audio coming from headphones and speaker. No volume controls worked and I've no idea whether the headphone or device mic was used. Maybe it's my particular device...,3,75,37.0.292994812,2020-02-19 18:52:51,,,rating,com.google.android.apps.meetings

I'm willing to bet most of the 1 Star reviews don't even have G Suite accounts and have NEVER even used this! Google should probably scrub these useless reviews for people to find out how the app is rated for people who actually would use this. It's a shame that so many people cluttered up the reviews and purposely are trying to bring it's ratings down just because they're butthurt about the direction Hangouts is going... Yet not even used the app they are reviewing.,5,19,1.1.148743531,2017-03-28 20:58:42,,,rating,com.google.android.apps.meetings
