Jeremy,Virtual meetings with lots of features,"As a coach, I did not want to limit my clients to driving distance, nor do I want to keep a dedicated office that I can bring ""strangers"" into, outside of my home.  Zoom not only allows me to meet seamlessly but allows my clients to meet comfortably in their own home (and not have to worry about baby sitters, etc).   The ease of use and multi-platform support removes any compatibility worries when setting meetings. ",,zoom
Jennifer,Zoom has allowed us to continue holding our meetings,"I've been utilizing Zoom to talk and meet with my collaborators while we're isolated gathering. With the current pandemic, Zoom has become a practically day by day program that I abuse for both work gatherings and virtual meetups with companions. I truly like how you'll have various clients on straightforwardly. I'm prepared to speak with various video calls. I abuse them for chapel meeting week by week and that they are incredible.",,zoom
Kristin,Zoom Meetings and Chat Review,We've used many different software programs to deliver our monthly webinar content and Zoom has proven to be the best program yet. It's ease of use and interactive functions are far beyond what we've used in the past and it allows us to successfully connect to our management teams monthly to deliver timely updates. ,,zoom
Uelinton,Our efficiency increased with Zoom,"We use Zoom daily for meetings with many participants. The recording feature is very helpful and, provide us with an opportunity to replicate knowledge and to record important meetings.",,zoom
Marilyn,"Great Online Meetings, Great Price","The Chatbox provides a valuable written transcript of the comments.  We also use the chatbox for Board voting so we know if there are differences of opinion that need to be discussed.   Recording is easy, so we can review the discussion or allow people who missed the meeting to view it.  We love the new Breakout Rooms, and Polls are great for maintaining interest.",,zoom
Ahmet Fatih,No Latency Video Meeting with Robust Infrastructure,We switched to Zoom recently and it has been serving very well. All our colleagues can easily meet online while they are doing their job at home.  It was really easy to implement and deploy on our environment.,,zoom
Nikola,Fun way to remote working ,"We started with free option at the beginning which allows 100 participant per meeting. The number of participants in a meeting is mostly less than 100 for our company. However, free option limits meeting period time to 40 minute. You need to restart the meeting every 40 minute. Therefore, after testing it for a week, we subscribed to Zoom. Overall, I am happy we chose Zoom for online meetings. In specific, online meeting tools becomes essential during these lockdown period and Zoom proved itself to us with its features and performance.",,zoom
Andy,Best audio and video conferencing we've used easily,"We needed a reliable audio and video conferencing platform to use for small meetings, all hands meetings, and training, among other things.  Zoom has always fit those needs perfectly.  Meetings are easy to setup, record and the quality is always top notch.",,zoom
Kerry,"Steeper Learning Curve than Hangouts, But Better Results","The quality of your meetings is much better than most videoconferencing platforms, so if it's a little less intuitive, it's probably still worth it.  And the free tier is still great as long as your meetings are 40 minutes long or less.",,zoom
Thao,Only use when most people use it for meetings,"If the speaker has bad internet quality, it will be super hard to concentrate and understand what's going on in the lecture. Not sure if Zoom is capable of tuning down the video quality, for example, to compensate for the bad quality audio. It doesn't seem to be the case whenever my host got cut out. ",,zoom
Anonymous,Robust and dependable conferencing platform for remote working,"I usually conduct site inspections by going to the site, but due to the limitations arisen as a result of the pandemic I have to conduct these meetings and inspections virtually. The picture quality is top-notch and there is no lag especially in video. With a good internet connection, there is literally nothing we can't do as a remote team. Previously we were deploying Zoom as a conferencing tool for only international conferencing, or limited requirements, however now we are utilizing it for all of our meetings, video conferences and audio calls on a daily basis.",,zoom
Anonymous,Do You Zoom?,"The software has been essential to our business. We use the video and audio connection, the screen sharing, the white board, and the chat functions.",,zoom
Anonymous,Doesn't deserve the bad press,"Our organization is able to work around the world, thanks to Zoom. We couldn't do our jobs without it. Videoconferencing isn't a perfect replacement for in-person communication, but it's a lot better than just email or text. And lots of people are using it for non-business purposes these days and experiencing the benefits of video calls to replace social engagements, or just to facilitate conversations with people who are far away. The negative press is really unfortunate, because it's not the platform's fault - but the fault of malicious people using it in unintended ways. If Zoom wasn't so successful, it wouldn't be getting attention from people with evil intentions. We'll still use Zoom long after this has blown over, and are thankful for how it enables us to work efficiently even with a distributed team.",,zoom
Suzana,Modern Meetings Made Easy!,"Overall, Zoom Meetings & Chat has become a great way to get work done in a simple manner. Everyone is online now, and in person conferences are outdated. Whether you're working from home, remotely, or need several members in different states to jump on a conference, and watch your screen for training purposes, I would recommend it.  Overall it is pretty easy to use, but I would definitely RUN A TEST MEETING FIRST with at least one other person so you can guide colleagues accessing it for the first time.  I have used other video meetings, and Zoom has worked seamlessly for me. Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too.   I will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while.",,zoom
Madeleine,Surprisingly Good For Distance Learning,"Right now, my company is moving all language classes to Zoom for the foreseeable future until further notice, in order to commit to social distancing during the coronavirus crisis within the Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan regions. Although we are still within the first two weeks of transition, it has been a smooth one overall and both teachers and students (as well as company administrators) seem pleased enough in spite of the vast differences between virtual learning and in-person classes.",,zoom
Derek,Zoom beats rivals with better video quality and individual preferences,"We have remote team members all over the World and we have a standup everyday. Using good video really does make the personal connection stronger and the team works better with a stronger human bond.  The Slack integration is great. On a whim, we can go from chatting to Zoom by using ""/zoom"" in the Slack channel. This takes an issue from email, tickets, and chatting to a shared video conference where we can share screens and see what people are looking at and get resolutions faster.",,zoom
Melody,"Great for collaborative meetings where participants are in different locations, easy to use","For a period of time, I solely worked from home because I had young children. Zoom was a game changer for me! I was able to be present for staff meetings, have regular meetings with my boss(es) to discuss tasks & meet with other staff when needed to coordinate projects or train others.

Marki,Zoom: Easy to Learn and Should Replace Any Other Video Conferencing Software You Have,"Overall my experience with Zoom has been overwhelmingly positive. Once you get over the initial bumps in the road to figure out how to best use it, it shines as a software. I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing.",,zoom
Michael,Best Video Collaboration Tool on the Market,"Zoom has been a great investment for us.  We have never had software or any tool so quickly adopted by our users.  By using Zoom, we have cut costs on video conferencing and allowed ourselves to do more with less in regards to conferencing.  It has become the go to collaboration tool, and more user are doing video conferencing/screen sharing than they ever did with another tool. ",,zoom
Jason,Zoom Review ,I am very happy with our choice to move to Zoom. It is not very resource intensive and is more cost effective than Webex. No additional 'Firewall work' was needed to get it going on our network and the interface is clean. The web admin console is easy to use and makes managing licenses a breeze. We are able to save on the amount of licenses needed as non licensed user still has 45 minutes of meeting time. Users are normally prompted very clearly about how soon the 45min time will elapse and it helps to wrap up meetings. I highly recommend Zoom for any size organization. ,,zoom

Since Zoom encrypts connections end to end, it works out great. It also was really easy to use their API, and it was very well documented. We rarely had issues with reliability through Zoom being used directly within our software. I thought it was very easy to use, and a much better option than most other video platforms. We also made great use of the reporting mechanism to know how much utilization we were getting out of Zoom. And the meetings that we generated across the organization, since we purchased an API subscription, were easy to customize for the settings on each meeting.

As a project manager, I often throw together meetings to have quick agile discussions with stakeholders and ZOOM allows me to do just that. Even external clients with no experience using ZOOM can access it and use it with little issue. As with all products, the more people are comfortable with the tools that ZOOM provides, the greater collaboration can be. Once people understand this, they find ZOOM to be one of the best tools for their day-to-day and begin scheduling their own web conferences. I think that alone demonstrates how useful ZOOM can be.",,zoom

Amy,Very Easy and Convenient Platform for Remote Team Meetings & Presentations,"My experience with Zoom Meetings and Chat has been great. It's quickly become one of our team's most valuable collaboration tools. It feels like a shared meeting platform that's truly collaborative. Instead of one person starting and running a meeting, we can each step in and lead on-the-fly, naturally. So far, this platform feels more like your team being in the same room together than other professional meeting platforms.",,zoom
Amber Elizabeth,"Great for people that use technology, hard for some older folks ","While we survived on the free platform for a long while at one point, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the paid version to others as the features really add a lot of robustness.

There is a lot of information that must be copied and pasted into meeting invites and people often have questions about what link they should use. ",,zoom
Henry,Favorite software I use daily,"Solves the problem of meeting with people outside of the office with great quality audio, video and sharing. And constantly adding new, great features!",,zoom
Bob,Zoom works the best out all the systems I have tried.,"By using Zoom meetings, I am able to record for both, my audio podcasts and my video training programs by using one simple software. Prior to using Zoom, I was using two and sometimes three different platforms to accomplish the same thing I can do through Zoom!",,zoom
Keion L.,Reliable Conference Software,"My overall experience with Zoom is extremely good. The software is lightweight but very heavy hitting. It is packed with important features, controls and abilities. I feel this software one of the best on the market for audio video conferencing.  ",,zoom
Ben,Zoom is the Industry Standard for Me,"We have used Zoom for a little over a year and it has been an amazing experience.  We moved to Zoom from Webex, after people constantly having issues with that platform.  Zoom has been a night and day difference with user satisfaction sitting at a much higher rate than it was before.  ",,zoom
Francisco,The best tool for conference and group calls,"As I said earlier, Zoom is far superior to other tools in the market, even in its free version. We use it in our conference rooms and personal computers, with very good results in all scenarios (demos, support, remote daily meetings, etc.). Very user friendly and works really fast!",,zoom
Leif,"Great conferencing software, couple annoyances",Overall really positive experience with the software as well as the sales and support teams.,,zoom
Anonymous,"It actually works smoothly, unlike its competition","I could not be happier. Our institution has standardized on it, and it was one of the best I.T. business decisions we have made in the last 5 years.",,zoom
Andrew,Webconferencing for the agile workplace,"I use this product for countless meetings and I have always recommended it to co-workers. As a project manager, I often throw together meetings to have quick agile discussions with stakeholders and ZOOM allows me to do just that. Even external clients with no experience using ZOOM can access it and use it with little issue. As with all products, the more people are comfortable with the tools that ZOOM provides, the greater collaboration can be. Once people understand this, they find ZOOM to be one of the best tools for their day-to-day and begin scheduling their own web conferences. I think that alone demonstrates how useful ZOOM can be.",,zoom
David,A great alternative to GoToMeeting and WebEx,Zoom is a worthy competitor to GoToMeeting and Webex even if it still lacks some useful features. It does excel in large group environments and video screen participation. ,,zoom
James,Zoom video webinar meetings simplicity and power in meeting and webinar software,My overall experience has been very good and we have solidly used at least 2 other leaders in this category over the past 2-5 years.,,zoom
Jordan,Is it healthy to like a meeting and chat software this much?,Try the demo and see if it works best for your business. I know that I don't have any regrets.,,zoom
Amy,Very Easy and Convenient Platform for Remote Team Meetings & Presentations,"My experience with Zoom Meetings and Chat has been great. It's quickly become one of our team's most valuable collaboration tools. It feels like a shared meeting platform that's truly collaborative. Instead of one person starting and running a meeting, we can each step in and lead on-the-fly, naturally. So far, this platform feels more like your team being in the same room together than other professional meeting platforms.",,zoom
Amber Elizabeth,"Great for people that use technology, hard for some older folks ","While we survived on the free platform for a long while at one point, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the paid version to others as the features really add a lot of robustness. Any business that hasn't caught on to video chats can try this product for free and learn what they are missing! ",,zoom
