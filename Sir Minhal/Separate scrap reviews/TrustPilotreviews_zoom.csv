The product is good (except for constantly changing and confusing functionality and one day of no service at a couple of weeks ago). Customer service is utterly appalling, in fact seems to be non existent. They are billing me twice every month at the moment and will not reply to emails. Their robot chat facility on their website is utterly useless. Not sure want to do. I like the product, on the whole, but don’t want to go on paying double for it every month, so time to start looking elsewhere, I think.

""I made multiple attempts to change my zoom account from 2 licensees to 1 license throughout the month of May. These attempts included trying to use the website to change it which consistently resulted in an error that was being worked on. I called on two occasions and after sitting on hold for an unbelievable length of time, I was put through to an answering service that took my information and concern and said someone would be in touch with me. This never happened.  I also emailed the company twice and received no response. Ultimately, I wish I would have just canceled the subscription all together, which is what I did on the day I was notified they still charged my account for two licensees. I think that transaction is fraud, but since my request was to keep one license, then I am willing to pay that amount. Unfortunately, the ability to provide any proof of my attempts to rectify this problem can not be provided since, other than taking screen shots, everything is embedded in their site. I am disgusted in the terrible customer service and plan on filing a complaint with the BBB as well.

We have been using it for years and we cannot recommend it enough. It has almost never let us down. Not even on a single call for years.The pricing is reasonable. Initially we were using a monthly subscription, then we moved to annual. We once had a delayed payment for over a month, but they were understanding enough and kept our premium service running until we paid.Again cannot recommend them enough for business use.

Please, do not make the same mistake, find something else. Regards,Dusko             ",,zoom

And you’ll totally miss the essential meeting because Zoom’s update crashed the entire computer.  Even then, the paid version is overpriced for what it is.  So thanks Zoom. Wish everyone still used Skype.             ",,zoom
             Mark         ," Hopeless support, double billing ","                 My experience matches that of most people, it seems. The product is good (except for constantly changing and confusing functionality and one day of no service at a couple of weeks ago). Customer service is utterly appalling, in fact seems to be non existent. They are billing me twice every month at the moment and will not reply to emails. Their robot chat facility on their website is utterly useless. Not sure want to do. I like the product, on the whole, but don’t want to go on paying double for it every month, so time to start looking elsewhere, I think. What a shame, this company should be making a massive success of this product at the moment.             ",,zoom

Never could get phone service to set up properly and asked for a refund and to cancel. Got a reply on May 9 that they were looking into it. Never heard back. Just realized that they charged me for a second month. Using Skype or Teams for my phone service. Starting to look for options to Zoom for video and webinars. I expect a company (no matter who fast they are growing) to be responsive.             ",,zoom
             Tony Reihl         , ZOOM IS A DECEITFUL.... Don't give them your money ,"                 This is what I wrote to PayPal and I am pretty confident I will get some of my money back. ""I made multiple attempts to change my zoom account from 2 licensees to 1 license throughout the month of May. These attempts included trying to use the website to change it which consistently resulted in an error that was being worked on. I called on two occasions and after sitting on hold for an unbelievable length of time, I was put through to an answering service that took my information and concern and said someone would be in touch with me. This never happened.  I also emailed the company twice and received no response. Ultimately, I wish I would have just canceled the subscription all together, which is what I did on the day I was notified they still charged my account for two licensees. I think that transaction is fraud, but since my request was to keep one license, then I am willing to pay that amount. Unfortunately, the ability to provide any proof of my attempts to rectify this problem can not be provided since, other than taking screen shots, everything is embedded in their site. I am disgusted in the terrible customer service and plan on filing a complaint with the BBB as well. Thank you.THIS COMPANY IS A SHAM AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY LIFE!!! Use Google Duo, or WhatsApp. Their video quality is better and it is free.
