"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes.",zoom
"For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls.",zoom
"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool.",zoom
"Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere.",zoom
Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.,zoom
This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.,zoom
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. ",zoom
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.,zoom
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc.",zoom
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person.",zoom
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before.",zoom
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. ,zoom
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.,zoom
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.,zoom
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.,zoom
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things.",zoom
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection.",zoom
"I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype.",zoom
"Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool.",zoom
Zoom makes it easy to generate meetings and send them to parties.,zoom

"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate.

Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.,zoom

It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. ",zoom
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.,zoom
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc.",zoom
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person.",zoom
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before.",zoom
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. ,zoom
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.,zoom
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.,zoom
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.,zoom
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things.",zoom
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection.",zoom

Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.,zoom
"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes.",zoom

I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.,zoom
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom.

"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection.",zoom

"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription.

"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate.

Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.,zoom
"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes.",zoom
"For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls.",zoom
"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool.",zoom
"Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere.",zoom
Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.,zoom
This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.,zoom
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. ",zoom
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.,zoom
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc.",zoom
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls.

"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before.",zoom
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. ,zoom
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.,zoom
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.,zoom
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.,zoom
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things.",zoom

Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection.",zoom

This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.,zoom
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. ",zoom
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.,zoom
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc.",zoom
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person.",zoom
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before.",zoom
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. ,zoom
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.,zoom
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.,zoom
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.,zoom
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things.",zoom
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection.",zoom
"I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype.",zoom
"Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool.",zoom

"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate.

Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.,zoom
"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes.",zoom
"For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls.",zoom
"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool.",zoom
