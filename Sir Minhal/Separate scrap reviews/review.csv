Upgrade the app
Notification sound not working in samsung s4
i dunno why do i always error 103 when i sign in
It will not open
Wants access to everything. Talk about spy webb. Surely that is not needed if you should only have a call
Audio didn't work
download is pending for more than 1 hour.
great
I have not been able to successfully use the app.
Hate it because of my teacher
Wherever I go to upload videos to it it laods for a bit then stops... WITH NOTHING THERE. It works alright with photos but videos never workðŸ˜¡
I didn't let me sign in and I had the right info
Can't install
How to found class code
I should have slept for the last half an hour instead of trying to figure out this app.
"it worked fine and then it started not getting my notifications now i uninstalled it and reinstalled it then it said ""you cant use this account"" or something, please fix this bug! my teachers will get mad!"
it sucks
school
It keeps loving me out why
"I want to join random classes around the world and find new teachers , I can't browse classes on the app"
Unusable for me until it support Bluetooth headsets
always need upgrade when i wanna use it
should make meet and chat the same app called it hangouts for business
Google! Stop! What are you doing?  We can't tell what your direction is with Messaging on Android.
"Come on Google can't you just make one Unified app for all the communication. Hangout, Allo, Duo, Messenger, Voice now multiple Hangout apps as well."
Not working as expected
Incoherent
"Horrible, hangouts worked better before this split."
"So google has allo,duo,meet, Hangouts,chat,Android messages. Are serious? You confuse people, I understand that you want to keep the Hangouts User base but common, you make simple things complicated. Just include duo in Allo . And make Allo to support SMS so u can delete Android messages, and ofc Hangouts is dead already, it cannot compete against WhatsApp, messenger, Skype,Viber which are the top .. GUESS WHY. They have all in one apps , not one for chat, another for videos, another for chat but for professionals, another for meetings for professionals,another for SMS etc etc"
No way to switch to headset speaker.
"On my Mi5, whenever i join a meeting, sound of the phone goes off! Means i can't even listen to a songâ€‹!! Why this app misbehaves with everything... Please look into the issue. I have to use another phone Everytime for meeting. I am nougat now. Edit: Hi, i am not trying to listen to song while on the Gotomeeting session. I am saying that after joining and then disconnecting the Gotomeeting session, i am not able to speak or listen any sound from my phone. Even in the cellular call i am not able to hear anything. That's what my concern is. I have to restart my device and then i can place the listen to anything on phone normally. It all started when i tried to use sound recorder(in built phone application on Mi5) during a Gotomeeting session. After this incident Gotomeeting misbehaves everytime i join a session through app. Please suggest a solution."
Seems this does not have a free version just a free trial. Uninstalling.
Ok but have not been able.to install the app
terrible
It wouldn't let me into the meeting & the support team kept giving wrong info when called for help....
Please give us an option to use the old app.  This new app is bad.
"On opening the app, it closes abruptly."
Company Conf. Call
This app is so good really
Lack of video is very disappointing. Major failing as is the ability to show presentations from Android devices.  For such a major corporation this is such a let down from the Windows app
