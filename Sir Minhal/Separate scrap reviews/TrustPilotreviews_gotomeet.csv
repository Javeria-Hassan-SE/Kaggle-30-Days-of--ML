       Valentin     , Bad sales service ,"         Was contacted by a sales representative shortly after filling in the contact form on their website. We had a good discussion and agreed on a couple follow-up actions for them, including for example sharing the price rates for the extended list of international dial-in numbers. Never heard of them after that, no response to my follow-up requests. Neither by e-mail, linkedin (the sales rep. had sent me a connection request), or even their contact form... Strange behaviour, would not trust.       ",,go to meeting
