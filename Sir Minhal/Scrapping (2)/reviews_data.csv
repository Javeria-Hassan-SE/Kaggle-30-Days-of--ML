Upgrade the app
Notification sound not working in samsung s4
i dunno why do i always error 103 when i sign in
It will not open
Wants access to everything. Talk about spy webb. Surely that is not needed if you should only have a call
Audio didn't work
download is pending for more than 1 hour.
great
I have not been able to successfully use the app.
can i make video conference from polycom to zoom?
Can't hear anything
it won't download
I just tried and it failed to send verification the message was partial
hello please improve one thing.Keep all meeting idz save once they enterd in meeting.please do a desktop update for that as well.
unable to understand that what is this.
worst video quality
Where is link is slow then what we can do?
Watching a large call on mobile? Everyone that joins flashes an alert in the middle of the screen.
I cant here anything
"After installing and joining a meeting, my screen started flashing off and on, even outside of the app. I had to slowly work my way towards the task manager to force quit as my screen kept turning off. The moment I killed the app, everything started working again and I immediately uninstalled.  I have no idea how that got so messed up but considering the ridiculous level of permissions it wanted, it could be a million different things. (Samsung Galaxy Note 2 on Verizon, devs)"
bokvash
"Terrible audio on a good connection, terrible UI."
Won't even install.
Aw3some
No
"very disappointing app, features are good but phone gets hanged every time"
Won't open on my s5 active
"I couldn't login with my sso takes me to a webpage where I'm already signed 
in. When I click sign in I'm already signed in on the webview."
nice utility
"Haven't used the app.  Uninstalled it right after it was installed.  My complaint is that the app requires permissions to every bit of information, contacts, files, etc. on your phone.  NOTHING is confidential from Zoom.  Not your information, data, or even your phone device settings which Zoom requires permission to change.  I wouldn't trust this app on any device with any confidential information whatsoever."
Hardly worked. Waste of time
couldnt connect to my mtg
Can some one solve my problem? My connection to zoom is blocked by a firewall or proxy
2d
"Sound does not work, so I have to read the lips."
"I cant get sound. restarted phone, uninstalled app and reinstalled. still no sound."
Every time I try to do a video chat it says error 5.
Your speed is too low
It's so annoying. I can't seems to download it
"audio would not work, no contol panel, will not even try ro use this again"
"I guess it works for some and not for others. I can download it but can't open the app. Restarted my phone but still, nothing. It just won't open. Tried to download it in my tablet and it won't even download, tweet all my other apps are working. Weird. Sad. Moving on"
Unable to download app
This app doesn't let you go in with out a email and password this is the most werst app ever
Trying to join a meet and keep in valid ID
unable to join a meeting. been getting error 1132.
Works great but one big bug - I have my settings to join meetings with video off yet the app randomly turns the video on without my knowledge. It might be when my phone loses signal and then reconnects but still a huge privacy concern
poor
"Tried to use the app for a meeting but no one could hear me, nor could I hear them. Tried rejoining the meeting a couple of times and checked all permissions had been allowed in settings. So I missed out on an important part of my training because of this. Disappointing."
"Does not work correctly with corporate SSO server ;-( Unfortunately, for me. When I try to join a meeting, the application logout me. Additionally, it show me a request to download an version for Android, but I use it. Exactly, how can it be that the application shows a request to download of itself? Very strange!"
couldn't hear anything such a shame was looking forward to this
i have not access it's limited my phone
"Audio does not work for Android. Tried their fixes online, still nothing."
poor could not download video
error code 963.. wont let me install
Your app is not installing on my phone!!!!!!!!!?
I don't get it one bit
worst app ever
"Why no explanation for the permission for Location, including Precise Location?"
Nothin
Garbage
It will not work for me
"Never works I have an android s7 edge operation on android 8.0 I cant even 
connect to a simple meeting where the host has an iPhone... 2 thumbs down."
I really hate it my lots of time ruin in meeting but it any response. And I have booked for class but I am not able to start online class
very bad UI they should use mac app UI
I've unistalled and downloaded again with out sound.
Signing in through Facebook does not work. So you will have to create an account before joining the meeting. Opening through browser on smartphone or tablet doesn't work either it sends you to the play store.
useless on mobile. too complicated.
"BE WARNED for anybody not in the US, you give the app permission to use your phone and text msgs, so outgoing calls and texts are made to a US number. You will be charged an arm and a leg for long distance fees by your service provider for using this app."
Horrible.
Still downloading after a half hour. Does not seem right
I've been trying to download this app for more tgan 24 hours. This starting me to think why bother. i feel its a waiste of my time.
power changing
Am having issue signing in
Trying to download and it's not happening. sucks
unable to join
Good app
I will change my rating if someone explains how to record meetings and how to open PPT files.
Vvvvvvvvvvvvery good app u must download it
Will not work on android 5.0
"I have a samsung phone and this app is not cooperating with it, it says its 
not availabe"
I can't hear nothing!
I think its too heavy to be run on phone i.e. my phone restarts every time I try to join a meeting.
I can't hear
Does not work properly. Too Slow. No HD Voice
"When I try to uninstall Zoom app, it reboots my phone every time. 😡"
ZOOM SUCKS!!!! There should not be a time limit AT ALL!!!! no one should have to pay anything to use this app at all!!
Stucked all the time
"Use for sometime. Don't like it. Lots of lags, sometimes drops and unreliable."
every time I've had to rely on this for business because a client preferred it it ha skey me down.
"absolute garbage of app!! one time I can't hear, next time I can't talk..it's not like we're trying to teleport and it doesn't work. it's just the basic functions that this app is lacking!!"
wouldn't download
won't even download
I think it was terrible
"Absolutely useless, the most pointless conference call app ever! Really 
angry that you can't hear anything unless you dial is separately and then 
that doesn't even work! 😡😡😡"
"Heavy as hell, no web based option. Stop forcing people to download useless apps"
Tried logging in from the app as well as web...says network connection failed everytime
"Can't download.  Says ""pending""."
sound repeat again and again
sound doesnt work. whenever I try to join a meeting on the mobile app I can't hear anything.
HAppy
'i hate you zoom oofff i hate online classes
No privacy
Very bad
Bad
Terrible app. Better to use Google meet or something
It's very harmful app to steal our data also I don't want to use chines app
Worst
It's horrible it's very laggy and bad quality
Every Time Network Problem

Spy

Chutteiya

"My video is not appear , could I get it"
"I am unable to access this app, Can you pls help"

Impossible to stay connected to a meeting
Waste of time
Ewwwww
VERY POOR I HAVE HAD ALL OF MY MEETINGS THIS WEEK DISCONNECTED BY ZOOM DURING THE MEETINGS I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO ZOOM AND ONLY HAD A GENERIC REPLY I AM A LICENSED USER PAYING £15 A MONTH I AM VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS SERVICE AND AM ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR A BETTER SERVICE ELSEWHERE I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ZOOM AT THE MOMENT
Literal garbage. You could pick any number of better options.
Please make virtual background possible on Android
"Im trying to download zoom on my macbook and the only option its giving me to download it is on a mobile phone that I've not used since last October which has no sim, no internet connection and not on. It won't give me any other options, not even this macbook I'm on so It won't download on this macbook. Not only that when I tried to join a meeting and put the audio on, it said my macbook doesn't support audio so I got no sound. I had to go back to my iPad on which I only have to click on the app to get into a meeting. You can't even put clickable apps on a macbook & whats the point of this zoom app if it won't download onto the machine you're actually on!"
Useless. I was to join a Zoom wedding event. Tried for 45 minutes to download the app Got supreme runaround. Not geezer friendly. Ended up playing solitaire. Never got The app.😕
I used it once and then uninstalled but my Google Play Store still shows it as installed. Stupid that I can't remove it.
It's killing students lifeee 50% of internet is wasting for this
Hangouts exists
Reinstalled the app two to three times but its not opening.
Aa thoooooo😵😒jeena mushkil kr Diya 😷
IN PC HOW WE CAN INSTALLED ZOOM APP PLEASE TELL FAST BECAUSE MY ONLINE CLASS IS GOING ON
i face dificulties to install this app on laptop why?
"Hey, I could not sign in to my zoom app please tell me something to resolve the problem."
I cannot get signed in or download the app. Locked out for 30 then went back and could not download the app on my phone and cannot sign in with my google account or google play... Have a meeting tomorrow at 4 pm. Looks bad for me.. I am using a Samsung 10+ and GMail address should work... Said it is invalid and does not work with a password change. I will give one star for getting lost and no help...
I have tried and tried to get on to a zoom meeting with no luck! Over it!
Worst app it is not working in my phone 😡😡😡
I have installed this app on my Huawei android phone.In play store it says installed but I can't see the app icon on homescreen.if anyone can help
I kept on installing it ..Google verifies my address..but the App never surface on my phone??
5 lakh-plus Zoom login details up for sale on dark web.
it cannot even get into your computer
Not good

Sharing data is very bad ...
Supposed I cancelled my membership and they charged me for another month. I will give you 4 stars if we solve this.

"porque no puedo instalar esto ? me sale que lo tengo instalado pero no es asi ,no lo tengo instalado en ningun dispositivo"
It takes too long to download your tablet
i have installed zoom cloud meetings app from google play store and it is showing as installed. i am not able to find the location where it is installed and how to activate it. zoom helpline chat is not understanding what my issue is. can any one inform me the path where the app is installed.
This app is a joke not working on my android smartphone. Cannot get audio or video.
this app is horrible it poorly works and steals your information
Hello C.C.

Kaise iske profile banaya

Not safe
Why I cannot install the app
zoom app is downloaded in my mobile but unable to connect in laptop
Terrible
"When I try to join a meeting I can see everyone clearly, but I have no sound and I can not enable my mic. I went through all the troubleshooting I can think of. Uninstall and reinstall app - Still doesnt work, Enable all app permissons for the app - Still does'nt work, Check if mic is not muted - checked, Try pushing the enable audio butoon in-app - Does'nt work Just nope... uninstall. Use something else that works"
never ever clear voice during meetings and continuous disconnection during all the meetings.
dont it will be not secure !
"Totally confusing setup and came up with some gobbledegook error message in computer speak....fairly typical really of software geeks! Is it Zoom or Zoom CLOUD for example? Who knows? Does it work with Opera browser? Apparently not.... When you download it, it doesn't even confirm it has successfully installed?"
i am trying to download in my pc but it automatically down load in my mobile plz guide me
Hell app uses most of the mobile data
I cannot get this app onto my home screen. So bad I have so many meetings and cannot participate in any. So lost tried all the waysI knew
😕😕😕😕😕😕
"Govt. of India declare is unsafe also found out that hackers to sell Zoom video app data for approx ₹23 Lakh that around 29,987USD this app is not safe at all, I am terminating my account right away hope they didn't sell my data already #boycottzoom"
"I have downloaded twice, asked for a password once, how do I log in for a meeting. Cannot work out how to get in to Zoom. ."
Since the update I continually drop out of the meeting I am in - really disappointing
"No audio. Permissions granted, checked in settings. Tried connecting headphones via BT or jack, neither works. Doc page not helpful as it seems to show old information."
not safe it's Chinese item that 😂 doesn't last long
Bad experience
Chines app
"oh this made a mess of my phone, it reset my setting in all my apps. had to use this app to do a chat with my insurance, to find my other apps on my phone were all screwy. to make sure nothing was left behind of this thing i did a reset on my phone over it."
In this app recently many hackers activities going on.. Newyork time is say many accounts data is cheating this app
Just take it down for a few months so students don't have to deal with it
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! I downloaded this on my phone and it has ruined my phone, I uninstalled with 12 hours but since I downloaded the app it has restarted on its own repeatedly. I talked with a service technician for my phone and the service rep can't do anything but tell me to take it to a repair place."
"Super laggy to the point of being unusable; meeting recordings also fail to load halfway through, super annoying."
Cannot even install this app. please help.
tried it on two tables and two laptops and cell done! does not work on anything I have. don't waist your unless your device is less than two years old.
This sucks
Bad so bad
No
hallo warum kann ich die app nicht auf meinen leptop benutzen er zeigt mir immer an das es auf mein handy ist
how do I sign into a meeting
Can't get into a meeting or start one.
Still there should be zero rating
badest app ever
it doesnt work on my laptop and it says i must use a phone!!!!
Could not get it to play and very irritated. What a collosal waste of time
Doesnt work
I downloaded this app to use for school and it tells me its installed but there is nothing.Is there something wrong with the app? What should i do now cause i need it urgently for school. How do i accept requests if i just sign in without downloading the app? Can u fix the problem and let me know.
Horrible app
ko thể tải về đc đã tải từ tối qua mà bây giờ vẫn chưa về.dở tệ
After 2 days of downloading can't find the app even though it says suitable for my mobile and PC
"hi, it shows 'installed' but the icon does not show anywhere on the laptop screen. can somebody please help?"
Faltu app Fake & useless app👎👎👎👎👎👎i hate this app
How I use it on PC
It's too heavy as an app
"Hi Dev. I have been using this for an year and never had a problem. After the phone got updated to nougat, the app is making the whole phone audio to mute once I start the app. I had to restart to get the audio back. I am using MIUI on MI5. Appreciate if it can be fixed."
aà
"Basic features don't work correctly, particularly link handling (you can't click a meeting URL and have the app pop open) and audio (it will route meetings to Bluetooth A2DP, and there's no way to transfer to handset even if you have a Headset). The UI is also unclear (e.g., the ""speaker"" control) and annoying (speaker is on by default). Finally, UI components are hinted in such a way that security managers (LastPass) think meeting numbers are passwords and try to save them."
I solve math problems with my brother and the picture is always out of focus and there is no way to readjust the focus of the camera. Miserable.
No
Audio issues : Couldn't hear a word that was said in the meeting.
"Amazingly, the Linux experience has gotten even worse. It seems to force itself to all virtual desktops, with no way to disable it. I previously only saw that with Wayland but now xorg is doing it too. Any time I share, the remote ends shrinks down to an unusably small window that makes it nearly impossible to see any listener reactions. Mic volume seems to be some form of /dev/random every time you start the app (which is always because I killall when I'm done). Overall unimpressive. -1 star"
The app is simple to use and configure. However once disconnected it impacts the data connectivity
not sure how it work at meeting id?
choppy
"Zoom ain't working in UAE i guess. Could you please work on that? I so much 
need it"
it is usefully
Why do you need access to user's Google drive? It may be having personal information.
good
"it is an okay app but could be better because when any participant joins from their Android phone their audio is so low if they are using the loudspeaker of their phone, I think it is an issue with zoom's audio algorithms on Android devices since other video calling apps don't have the same issue , the audio gain needs to be increased . also when anyone tries to join don't make the default audio method is a prompt asking which audio source to use since very often non techy participants are expect"
"When I am clicking the 'sign up' button, it shows a pop-up bar which contains a message that my internet connection is failed to sign it up. I don't know what to do further. Please help me with your kind suggestion."
"The permissions this app requires don't make sense with what it does, I am not comfortable it poking it's nose every area of my phone. I have to use it for one meeting, once done I am getting  rid of it."
"Tried using it on multiple devices and was unable to hear the speaker, who was not muted according to other meeting attendees. Very sad to miss this meeting."
"my professer uses this to do online lectures. I usually use it on the computer, but since it broke I had to use a tablet instead. The audio doesnt work when during the meetings so i can't hear his lectures"
The description mentions Screen Sharing however I am not able to find/figure it out. So far its basically just a watered down version of facetime.
The app is good. But too many problems in hearing persons clearly
nice one
good
"Didn't auto mute by default when I joined despite showing an indication 
that I was muted. An absolute deal breaker. Adding a star because they seem 
to care about the app and contacted me to address it."
"Doesn't work on my S6 Edge, it used to work before, I'm guessing it is related to an update in the app?  I can sign in, but none of my contacts show, and I keep getting this message constantly appear and disappear that says 'click to re-activate your messenger'.   Of course, nothing changes when I try to click on it.  I tried clearing app data, cache, reinstalling, and nothing works.  Useless.  When it worked, it was particularly annoying to answer a call on the computer also running zoom, but the phone kept on ringing and ringing."
😘😘
Get lost
"works ok, but the audio are not coming out on my Bluetooth Headset. Just working down the wired."
"Ever since I've updated it, it won't work!!! Please fix or help i use a Samsung tablet and everyone uses this app in my meetings so i can't change it i really need to attend  my meeting. please help thank u"
Can't download
"user experience leaves a lot to be desired, even after video training. Mobile app and computer app totally different functionally. Great potential but not intuitive"
i don't recieve notifications.... only when i open the app they already
"it's not very user-friendly, the little buttons at the bottom when I'm using my tablet it messes with the buttons at the bottom of my tablet so whenever you go to do a video share or I mean screen share or something like that then it either shuts off or the person can't hear you or it's just a hassle it it really really is it's not very user-friendly"
Its sad... One of my important meeting got recording with mp4 but there is not video in it.. I don't know what to do now?
You can't screen share all types of Google Drive file types. You can't see yourself on video nor flip you camera from front to rear while presenting like you can on iOS. That was always useful during meeting. I left iOS for Android and now forced to use desktop verison to meet because of the lack of features on the mobile app compared to iOS. Which sucks because I love to walk and talk. What's up with that zoom?
I'm in UAE and I'm not sure if that is the reason why I cannot sign in. Keep on connecting but never connected. I would appreciate if you can guide and give me any solution with this.
price high in India Ruppes 😢😡 not support My review 😞☹️😭😭😭
السلام ورحمة
"App is totally useless without working Push notifications. I can't believe 
an app from a company of this size can't get something as simple as 
notifications right. Mine don't work unless I have the app open and even 
with it open in the background it stops receiving notifications after a few 
minutes. When I logged a support ticket with Zoom I got told it could take 
weeks to sort. How I'm supposed to tell that to all my staff who use it!"
Used it for a year. Each time there is a software update to my Android 5 my data records disappear so it's useless as a long term health monitor. Other than THAT...it was great....
Its good..
"Все отличающие от конкурентов возможности платные, при регистрации сообщает ""Укажите действительный адрес электронной почты"", хотя адрес рабочий, и введен правильно. После отправки жалобы через форму обратной связи никакой реакции, ни уведомления о получении сообщения, или ответа. В приложения для Windows ввожу email и пароль (после активации) - ""Конфигурация Zoom Rooms не настроена для этой учетной записи""."
"Basically works, but pales in comparison to the iPhone app. I can't figure out for the life of me how to save a meeting id even though I've connected to it dozens of times (I am logged in). Lots of little quality of life improvements in the iOS app that just are not present in this one. I would be much happier if they'd even add a drop down for recent meeting ids....this exists on literally every other platform Zoom supports. As it stands the only way I can connect to a meeting is to manually type the ID in everytime or open my calendar, find the meeting and click a zoom link inside of the description."
Zoom has rencently started disconnecting my connection on Samsung Galaxy 9
"First time using the app on my Pixel 2 and it caused the phone to shut off due to overheating. Before that sudden interruption, the call was fine."
"Recent update has caused app to not work with my chrome book, Version 64.0.3282.190  I use Zoom frequently and need to find a work around or solve the issue."
Views clean enlarges well.  Would be nice if chats can be shut off.  Chats between attendees annoying as they cover to much of the screen too much on a cell phone.
My friend got on and we tried to video chat it it started squeaking really loud. I couldnt even hear her
horreble
Sorry but I could not hear anyone in the meeting.
App having problem in opening
When it works its good.. i cant ever get the audio to work automatically or at all this i hate 😡 😡 😡 im missing meeting chats etc. I have an Android and its very difficult.
"Extremely long download on mobile, it's not too stable, video cuts out , 
sound has static on Samsung note 8."
nice app but could have been lighter than 37 mb
Impossible to download app. Several attempts made.
Not getting notifications for new messages
Rxffd TRD r TX TX rrrxfxxfxftdxxxxdxxt yeah ball where about how you about
This app works awesome
"I just downloaded Zoom onto my Tab 3 so that I could participate in a training webinar. However, when I tried to open the app, I goot an error message ""not suppported on this device.""  REALLY???"
Couldn't get it to complete the down load. Just keeps running and running.
Was asked to use zoom for interview..ended up using whatsapp video call..sorry
not good
"Never notifies me of messages. I checked my settings and it is set to 
notify me even when the desktop app is active, but it still doesn't work."
To long to download
I'm so disappointed that the free version kicks you out after a certain amount of time and asks you to pay $15 a month. They would be better to add extra features to upgrade because now I don't even wanna use it! Otherwise call quality was pretty good.
Please add Samsung and Google (s)pen support to the whiteboard share feature.
"No other apps use the camera, I just view them but I cant start my camera."
Very slow for call in uae.. Need to know person who read messages or not. Voice and video clarity level need to increase. Connection issue even full coverage wifi ...do work more i ll suggest all my other team.
"With free space , i can not easily Still Download the app,eating up my data!I can not get it downloaded,its Getting frustrating!?!??"
Please update the app as it consumes 29% of my phone's battery
My only wish is that they would not auto start video the moment you opened the app. You're going to get people fired. I'll update to 4-5 stars once you do as Google hangouts does to verify you are ready to start into conference and can adjust your settings.
no way to find people
Doesnt find gmail saved contacts. Most android users should know not to save your contacts to the phone but to your gmail account. It seems zoom only looks for contacts saved to the phone because it cannot find a single contact.
Good
"I loved the app in the beginning as it allows for more users to group chat 
and video conference in than most services. However, in the last few weeks 
or months for that matter I have not been able to receive Any of my 
notifications and it's very frustrating. I will go back and have days worth 
of conversations that I've missed."
Was not a good experience for me.  Very choppy video and sound.  I was on a good connection.
Mute doesnt work on Pixel. I was in a meeting with my team only to find out everyone knew I was in the shower because they could hear the water running. Not cool.
Can not get on
Not able to download.. Its loading for long time
Good but the privacy policy is very scary
"Warning. Latest update rly buggy! Getting notifications, but no messages are updated and shown in app itself. Force close fixed this, but unsure for how long. Following update made things even worse.. Way to break a good messenger, devs!"
This app took me away from netflix!😡
ok
poor reception
Video quality is good
its not useful
"app has so much potential but it's so badly constructed and has so many faults, it makes it too frustrating to use."
Latest update broke the tablet view!
"Audio quality is poor, integration with Google calendar is good, but does not work with work profile on phone, so cannot sign in to zoom from mobile app. Overall a below average experience..."
There are many bugs admin please fix it this is very useful app
Chettha app
Cant install
"When I'm in a meeting, my Video camera pauses when i type in the chat."
I couldn't click the share screen button on the pop up
"Just so everyone knows, these geniuses have never used this app so they set 
the default to audio on and video running"
"Tried to download the app, i wanted to join a meeting but it kept on requesting."
y cant hear the sound
Often getting disconnected
Sux
how can i change my device
"It's has been working okay on my desktop until recently whenever I set for a meeting,when its started am unable to use it since when I click to open it hides on the task bar at the edge of the computer screen. What could be the problem? I need help because there's alot that am missing ."

.can you please tell me how to uninstall zoom as I installed it incorrectly and now need to start again. Thankyou.
"installed zoom on my Samsung android phone which seemed to work fine. then tried to install zoom on my lap top as wel but the download kept telling me it was already installed, asssuming my phone. So in my wisdom I deleted it from my phone. Then attempted to install it again on my Laptop...nice try? the download window still tells me it is downloaded already, which I know its not HOW CAN I DOWNLOAD IT ON MY LAPTOP...AS MY ONLY DOWNLOAD?????"

Que des problèmes de son. Sur portable et sur ordi.
Why only 40 minutes but whatever the schedule time should be given to the client for meeting. 40 Min is not enough for meeting.
Not able to sign up as i am unable to set Password to login
taxiways 6
It takes up your batture and it does not insatll or work this app if it work better and not so hard i would use it more ofthen
It'd be great to come with instructions while new to meetings and just as installation occurs.
Need to have more time to let people interact with their group meetings more
Frequently getting stuck
Dont know yet
very poor directions
Unable to share while in meeting.
Unable to download the app
Hello sir
Retr
I'm barely getting into this app..
No good for mi
Sound was terrible
Good
Does not always work perfectly
Can't understand the process
"Zoom share feature is lacking the interchangeable share. I must exit one before using the other share options. ZOOM should allow switching between share features. Also, when i share a youtube video. zoom mobile only display the link. this is bad. please fix this so the shared youtube thumbnail is displayed. this is the industry standard . No screen capture , WHITEBOARD CANNOT IMPORT IMAGES OR PDF FILES. CANNOT SHARE FILES. NO DYNAMIC SHARE SWITCHING."
Finding it hard to download app
No way to test or change audio settings
Taking hours to load
What is the 3078 error code ?
i m unable to download it
"The Android version of this app is terrible. When creating a meeting, it is not possible to sync to your Outlook calendar. I have seen screenshots and articles showing that you can do it on iOS app. When I create a meeting it doesn't add to my Outlook calendar. Have to do that manually and that's annoying. The video quality is good as is the audio quality. But the connectivity to third-party apps is bad. Please fix this to make it on par with your iOS app."
Meeting was freezing and coming in and out
"App keeps crashing (closes suddenly) repeatedly throughout a 20 minute call without notice. This happens while hooked up to an ultra strong wifi. This does not happen on the web version, just the mobile app. Please contact me with any advisement."
For some reason the app keeps kicking me off of the call I've been on for the last couple of days. Like every couple of minutes... No issues when I access the same call on a different device though...
zoom notification won't go away unless i restart my phone. constantly says I'm in a meeting even though it's clearly ended
Too confusing. I can't figure it out.
Zoom crowd meeting
How do I watch a recording from link using the app
I can't hear audio.
Is this available India location
it doesn't work properly in sudan
The audio doesn't work properly.
ihave already installed in my phone but i couldnt able to install in my pc
I can't hear audio. Reinstalled app and did all the troubleshoots.. I'm in a class where I need this app once a week and it would be nice to hear what's being said! Headphones don't do anything
Okay so we are on day 2 of our meetings & theres only 3 of us in the meeting & I keep getting dropped & have to rejoin the meeting like every few minutes & the sound was echoing & computerish 😣 HELP
Share screen refuses to share video or sound in the mobile app. There are no options to optimize sound and video in the mobile app. Basically the mobile app sucks.
Wo
Sound stopped on both aps phone and computer
Good communication experience but ui/ux is truly horrible
I would like to give 5 STAR when you add India Country in Zoom app...
Please update the app as it consumes 29% of my phone's battery
Wont open or let me download. I've used it before...
The latest app version keeps on crashing. Please fix
"It is becoming more unusable!!!! When on a zoom call it still allows your mobile phone to ring over the top of the zoom call. I must be the only person who uses the zoom phone on the a phone!!!! Looking at ring Central It's getting more unusable... The best is now if you are on a zoom call and another soon call comes in, forget about! The app is so stupid it doesn't know your on a call and it runs anyways LOUDER THAN HELL!!!! Now I'm deaf!"
Problem downloading the app
"Not soo good voice was disconnecting between program and also disconnect itself after some time , then it again reconnect between the program"
"UI outdated, emojis not showing when sent from desktop (says just [emoji]), notification doesn't always pop. Needs more work, feels on mobile like software in beta."
Just okay
Somwwhat works. Often buggy and annoying.
I am trying to download the App however if has been over an hour and it is not downloaded. I missed a very I.pirrant meeting.
Not sure why there is no way to simply share a meeting link. You have to go through all this brouhaha to pull up the link. Just put a meeting link so that it is easy to grab and copy! What's so hard about that concept????
I cant hear anything
"when it's my time to connect with my coach,if I click on join my phone automatically goes black I can't hear his voice I can't see any picture. I have same meeting in less than 30 miniutes .I NEED HELP"
Not to the mark
Sometimes if I open the app on my phone running Android 9 and either call in or have the app call me I am unable to mute or unmute myself. The worst is when I can't mute myself even if I mute myself in the zoom session and on my phone call.
I also have the same issue. I can't hear the other person without headphones. Which is very inconvenient. Pls fix this. Thank you
It would be nice if you could change your meeting ID without having to upgrade.
The sound qaulity
How do I record on zoom app using Samsung Galaxy phone?
It never lets me in when Im sent an invite to join a meeting. The app never downloads.
Fair
Can't hear the other person
I think its a good for metting on the live
Hi. May i know why i cannot initiates chat or calls. I haave downloaded the apps and log in using SSO. But it seem like it doesn't not working
"After Android 10 update on my Pixel XL 3, Zoom will no longer play sound on my Plantronics PLT Fit via Bluetooth. Zoom is working on my PC with a USB headset. The Android app is on the Google Play Store so it should play nice with a Google-branded product. My Bluetooth headset is very loud on other apps so I know the issue is not the headset. There seem to be only two modes on the Android app when the PLT Fit is connected via Bluetooth. One shows the Bluetooth icon but plays through the phone speakers. The second plays sound through the external speaker. To me it appears that the Bluetooth icon is mislabeled. Should there not be three modes--external speaker, regular speaker and Bluetooth speaker?"
Had to reinstall
Why share your screen option is missing ftom the update.? Please rectify the issues..
"After updating to Android v10 incoming calls no longer ring, not much good for a phone system."
Loud speaker not working on oneplus6 from latest update. please fix ASAP
Great to have a meeting with multiple people but find the audio quality is lacking - quite choppy
Bissnis
Just started using it its okay
St
not too bad
"Decent app. Definitely useful when you have some down time. Only thing is, it won't let me upload a profile picture. I've tried multiple times but all it tells me is the connection failed and to try again later. Hope this will get fixed in the near future. Other than that, it's a pretty OK app."
"The app works well but the Android version has less options then every other platform (iOs, mac, pc, linux). I use this app to collaborate with my team, but i can see only 4 people per screen so have to scroll through, whereas they can see up to 49. every other platform seems to also have Virtual Backgrounds which is missing on the Android version."
Cannot share screen on android.
Video and audio quality becomes poor
Erteffv
Ok fine call
सही चलो शुद्ध बनो
great apps
its always slow and lagging
H hello
The app seem so cool but you guys need work on quote message and the connection issue
BUT.. stays on in background with no way to exit.
I'm facing an issue unexpected error code.
Good .....
good convesation
"for mobile use, current version is good in desktop old version was much better then new version"
"I love this app in all of its forms. Desktop, I pad and android. What it suffers from the most on the android platform is battery life. I will be on a 1 hour meeting and loose at least 55% power. I've been on meetings that lasted longer and had to leave the meeting abruptly due to my phone dying."
"High quality conferencing, but the app design is so unintuitive to a new user. Really hard to use, which is a shame given how great Zoom meetings are."
interesting
😐
Nice app
"Hi,Is there any way to play a mp3 file during meeting?"
"Love this on desktop as I am able to record audio / video of meetings. Although mobile app asked permission to record, I don't see anywhere where I can start / stop / view recordings that are made... Help?"
Why is your app accessing my camera in the background???. Seams a bit weird
7/15/2019 Zoom we still have issues with low audio levels in our conferences from mac tablets and some Mac notebooks and all in ones. still having overdriven mic with my Bluetooth earbuds which use a popular audio chip 10/6/2018 Zoom your app is irreplaceable and has done great things for a lot of people. Please polish the functionality in the Linux version and fix issues with super low or overdriven audio. There seem to be hardware issues or automatic gain control issues on so many devices.
Mr.
I think its ok. Just that the UI is dated & could use an upgrade.
it doesn't have record option.
On okay
not working while some apps use screen overlay
After updating to android marshmallow zoom doesn't run anymore can you help on this? Zenfone 2 android 6.0.1
Us120263
OK
"I love this app and use it alot BUT it does not have the feature to upgrade 
to Pro!! Please help! I would love to be able to zoom longer then 5 minutes"
The app is good.  It needs to show more callers on the same screen at the same time.
No volume and im having a hard adjusting
Aight
keep on disconnecting
It cut off and sometimes l can't connect
"Me gusta el nick por defecto que tiene la app al momento de hacer un join, lastima que no puedo subir la captura de pantalla. Muy buena la app!"
Speed
"If audio and video can't be in good transmission due to bandwidth problem, audio should be kept in good condition, esp. in a meeting circumstance."
size of this app is to much
Thnx
Not working in UAE anymore 😥😥
Heats up the device crazily
"App continues to restart and drains my battery, so uninstalling."
It does the purpose it was created to perform!!
good innovation
The app keep on closing and launching itself..I was not able to attend one of the meetings.. so annoying
Ok only
Not bad
"Even though I allowed access to everything Zoom wanted access to, I thought it odd that when I joined a meeting, both video and audio were off by default.  On Nexus, the app does not seem intuitive.  Perhaps it behaves differently on other phones.  The biggest problem I had was losing audio when someone called me while I was attending a video meeting.  I had to leave the meeting and re-join in order to get audio back."
"We use this app all the time depending on your internet connection you can have a meeting without problems or a mess of a meeting. Best meeting is on a stable fast speed internet connection. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM with this app is the fact that you cannot use your computer for other things, such as using different webrowsers or opening other documents at the same time it's running because it will Freeze your screen and make your meeting a living hell.  Then you look incompetent.  Please fix this!"
"Please disable auto rotate... & also option to disable speaker phone on 
meeting join."
good
"am giving 3 stars because, when using the app, after like say 30 - 40 minutes then it gose off, telling you that free period is over. please do something about it. thank you"
"Works pretty well but UI is clunky. In particular the Click To Speak circle is misleading. Tapping anywhere on the screen toggles the microphone, making it too easy to do this by mistake."
I'm yet to try my conference meetings..
audio became very crackly and was breaking up. This occurred about half way thru the meeting on our last two meetings. HEALcare groups
so cute
I just installing
Seems to work well... Just tried it out with my friend for 15 mins or. Will update my review once I've used it for a more considerable length of time.
"If like to see a few more features. I attend meetings where more than one speaker is relevant and while switching focus with audio is perfect sometimes there are meetings when I'd like to be able to pick more than one speaker video feed to pin. So i could have 3, 4 or 5 people enlarged and the remainder as scrollable thumbnails. It would also be nice if when another attendee sends a private message, i could click on their user name to take me to their video ad well instead of having to put my glasses on and read through every user name until i find them. Most people don't use familiar names and i hate to respond until i visually verify who I'm talking to."
Joined a meeting on my tablet today and couldn't hear it! I had to switch to my computer. I will have to try the mobile app again.
I think room has to be made for more participants attending meeting. Say like 1000 participants attending meeting or more.
accurate feedback
It problem freeze and reconnect
"Pixel 2 (Pie) overheats & shuts down in the middle of a video conference. All background apps were closed prior to using this app. Connected to LTE tower across the street w/ full signal. Had to switch to my old Motorola Nexus 6 (Pie, WiFi) to complete the video conference, which worked great and didn't cause any overheating issues."
Ok
Good
too big
BUT WHO. KNOWS AT LEAST NO STRANGERS CASING MY PAD!
"App works for video conferencing fine, however it knocked out the mic for  speakerphone on all apps. Had to uninstall. On a S9+ ."
Testing
it's not so steady on chrome book and when i shared screen it just kept crashing. i hope they get a fix because i have always preferred zoom rather than skype and i need it for work.
"It would be waaayyy better if they just allowed you to do a simple screen share without having to be in photos videos or a specific web page, I need to be able to share other content located on specific apps on my phone and I'm not able to do that..."
how i can record my meeting through android phone?
love  it
It disconnects a lot while having poor connection. Not quick on reconnecting again like Skype. If that is resolved then it's a good app
hoping this works
"Every 30 minutes, app stops and needs restart all over again!"
Is very encouraging for communication
good.. even if sometimes no connection at all ... overall ok
Device onall books
"Even though internet connection is prefect it is showing all contacts 
offline its happening since from last twoydays"
This app would be perfect if I could down load it to my nextbook
I dont know why apple version can send receive messages and this one cant
thanks for your help in this matter
Partially okay
Kept dropping out from a otherwise ok session over a WiFi network. Not sure if it's the app or the WiFi coverage.
App restarts a lot when you open a chat and constantly has to reconnect and update the chats even when you have received a notification from the app.
will this work as a zoom room controller instead of and ipad
"This is a good tool to have,once it get's installed.Very useful."
"Can't get into groups!!! Other than that, it seems ok"
Thanx for add remove and block for noise contacts

"New user, I have problems joining in on the scheduled webinar."

DBA ONE TEAM ONE DREAM OOHH  YESS
good
UI is really poor!
Good for meetings
I just had to Uninstal to see if there's a problem with installation. I am not able to sign in when I open it can't even reset password if that's the problem please fix.
"High CPU heat,  confusing UX, the need to specifically accept audio/video device make  conference start slow and cumbersome. Joining before start will not ask these permissions and you'll sit waiting forever with muted audio without knowing it already started."
"Zoom app ""cannot be updated on my device."" Verizon Tablet"
"Great app but notifications have stopped working since last update. My 
company use this app for most messaging so have missed many messages until 
I have opened the app"
Keeps logging in and out on its own
how can i access sd card files??
good
A wonderful meeting tool to network with on social media.
"Earlier, sign with company's domain SSO worked fine. Now, it opens in 
browser and it's not mobile friendly"
Quality is hit and miss. First three Zoom meetings were perfect. The last two were absolutely dismal.
"Has the update for today had an issue with opening zoom.us meeting links no longer by default? For the past 6 months, meeting links would open directly in zoom after I was initially asked whether to open on the web browser or the zoom app. Today's update now causes links (at least on my Galaxy S9+) to open only on the web browser, and I have to wait for a button to show up on the web page in order to launch the Zoom App. Please look into this, as I am guessing I am not the only person experiencing these unnecessary and cumbersome additional steps."
More
"We use Zoom for our business and it is a great platform overall. Has apps for Windows, OSX, Linux, and smartphones. On the Android it loses some points with us. When you get a message it just says Zoom message in the alert with no additional details. So I have no clue if it is something important or something that can wait. The UI does not really fit well, but is functional. Camera on by default is a bad idea. Can be changed, but that should be a choice up front."
nice
good
There is no access to click links from the chat page and also to copy messages
How to record video from mobile? I can not find any option..
"It's ok.  It drained my battery and overheated my phone.  Once I uninstall the app, no problems.  I guess it's good to install only for meetings and uninstall afterwards."
Can't update
Video ok and during conferencing can you make one members feed be on focus when Choosen

Its good to communicate each other
"I'm not sure why the audio integration is so poor.  90% of the time if using the app on mobile, I have it call my phone.  It always tries to control Bluetooth, speaker or handset audio.  This always fails, and if I can make it work, it fails once I try to switch from wired head set to speaker to Bluetooth, etc.   Otherwise, the app is okay.  But please let my phone control the audio."
network pressure makes it a bit difficult to be consistent during the meeting
-__- :(
Good app
Nice
Does what it says on the tin
Very good
"First time using it and there are some delays and freezes, but it's not bad"
Its ok
"Only one option for installation it doesnt allow 2nd device to install same app. Can anyone advice on how to resolve this,want to add it to my laptop!  Thanks."

overall nyc app
doesn't work with bluetooth earphone
"Couldn't connect to meeting, constantly asked to sign in And it is annoying"
Voice network doesn't work properly. Please try to fix it
Good app
ok
"The only thing I would give this app 5 stars for is conferencing ability, othervise not the most user friendlyest of apps and very laaaagggggy with only 2 parties talking (yes this was with extremely fast internet and wifi) I can only imagine that with multiple people conferencing would only get laggier and video quality is no better than other popular alternatives. (not to name any)"
Great connectivity
"Good image quality and low latency. I can't see both the video and the chat/questions window at the same time though, this is very impractical for online seminar/classes. Please fix and you'll have a winner."
"On my Nexus5x phone, the Zoom started using the main dynamic on the phone, instead of usual telephone dynamic, so everybody can hear the call, and it was not possible to decrease volume by the control. This wasn't the case with our previous corporate teleconferensing."
low cuality
As soon as someone joins my speakers start quietly ticking and I can't hear anyone. I reset my phone and sometimes it works briefly. If I could hear the meeting I would give this app a 5
"Good utility app! On a Pixel 2 XL has issues with sound quality and 
interferes with Bluetooth., such as incoming phone calls will kill 
Bluetooth connection in zoom, forcing to switch to speaker and back to 
Bluetooth to reconnect. Battery hog.."

"What's happening with the audio?????????? And no, the phone is new so there's no way it is the phone ☹"
i guess you need to make video sharing switched off as default option .
Please enable screen sharing on android !
"good sound quality, help alot in online meeting"
cool
"It's better than Hangouts in ways, but the interface is clunky on Android and the Linux application could use some attention."
It's nice but I really need to be able to record the meetings
Nathing
I cannot share my sound when sharing screens from my phone then streaming to a tv. I can however share my sound when I do a zoom meeting on a computer.
"Well, I haven't even started to go to my ""economic meeting"" and I read in the fine print that Zoom collects information about our cellphone numbers....PLUS personal banking information? I don't think so!!"
Good for meetings and interviews.
Good app es'ecially for video calls.
I tried it for the first time and it was good my only problem was that right in the middle of me teaching a class it told me my free trial is up and I have to pay $14.99 I thought this APP was free!!!....it would drop people in the midst of my meeting....can you explain what is going on?
Please add feature to join meeting by audio only as it will help in uninterrupted meeting experience while travelling when internet connection is not stable
Okay don't fully understand on how to used it though on my 4n.
Recently havung problems joining mtgs and no clue what happened to this.very easy and gr8 app. Frustrating n disappointing to use.
It could have been better. Voice was sketchy and I totally lost the video feed before the meeting was over.
Nice app
Resourceful but the UI sucks. Can be really hard to use
Nice

How to record a meeting
"when im in a zoom call study session, i have a lot of background noise so i normally mute my audio, but these days, my mic is turned on and off even if i didnt touch the icon. Every time i try to mute my audio, it gets unmuted and it doesnt tell that the host had done that or anything and when it gets unmuted the host mutes me and it shows me that the host did so. i gave 3 stars because the mic keeps turning itself on and off and its really annoying because i have to sit here and click the mute icon"
3 stars because it is very nice app and if there is no time limit it will be ok over all good app than all apps thank you so much.....

But every time is too much. For now I rolled back to previous version. Otherwise the app is great, we do lots of conference calls and it is very useful. Hope you can fix that ""issue"". Thanks!"

"I can't set my profile picture of my own. It always shows ""unable to upload the profile photo"". So Fix it soon."
Need to make it more simple and fast with reducing app size then it can be more popular
My experince was best with zoom apps.
Never used it before but heard good things about it
Didnt need the service. The version I got from play store would not allow you to terminate account. Had to sign in another way to access account. Didnt use it so I can't speak to how service us just app maintenance
It's ok
great

There were some disturbance in call quality and network.
The volume is too low.

"Annoying to turn off/log out, also biggest battery hog ever."
My country is not available in this app
Partially Good
All the well but sound not working after join meeting
"It does its job, but I would appreciate it if there were a convenient, or, if I'm missing something, a more intuitive way to keep a list of meetings you're signed up for, and preferably have the app start itself when a meeting starts. The cherry on top would be the ability to have different settings for each meeting."
Good
Good
Yes better than others but financial is high for long talks and meetings
Good
Find it difficult to use.
good
Zoom repeatedly disconnected and then reconnected.
Great
Voice un clear during meeting
"it doesn't work with android auto which makes zoom calls while driving a pain. while on a call or webcast, the volume won't come through the car speakers and it doesn't use the car's microphone."
Good application
Good
It's Good
Good
Can't use speaker phone or Bluetooth speaker
Mobile version could be improved...
Excellent
Ok
Good
Nice
It keep on cutting out when speaking I don't know why
Good
Needs improvement
Good but voice problem
Handy but not always stable and often time-limits the calls with a cut-off
Just started using it. I think its really good
App restarts a lot when you open a chat and constantly has to reconnect and update the chats even when you have received a notification from the app.
very good app
Very good but I'm getting awful video issues where it is clear for 3 or 4 sec then looks like static is overlaid on the video and you can't see anything. Hard to explain without screen shots.
Buggy and confusing though works better than most of the others
"Sometimes freezes, but this might have a lot to do with my connection. It's takes a couple of attempts before I can actually get connected."
"There should be a mode available in Mobile Zoom, where user while on a conference/meeting should not receive any call/ or let say auto reject all incoming calls."
Good
"Its a very good app,but it can't save your meetings"
"Hi Team, It's a wonderful app for scheduling & joining meetings. But the issue I was facing after recent update..speaker on is not working previously when we use speaker on the audio was out and we were able to place the phone on meeting room desk so everyone use to listen and respond in meeting but not sure after update I lost audio out option option is still visible for speaker on/off but both works same. Can it be fixed with a update? If so I am very much happy and comfortable with this app"
"Like it,, help me do my stuff"
👌
video and audio cutting out and disconnection
Nice.
The app is good only for screen sharing....The backgroud changer while on video is the worst and also there is a very much lag even when both have best wifi
"I wish I could hear the meetings I'm invited too. I really think this is a great app, I just can't hear anything at all. I would love to be able to use it."
Sound difficulty.
Great
Sometimes unclear
Network should be strong
Good
Audio issue after entering the meeting - there is no audio heared for couple of minutes. Even after trying to switch to speaker or headphone route also does not work. After around a couple of minutes or more the audio is heared. This is 90% times happening. Needs exit & re+enterWhy is this audio issue not resolved properly as I see many reviews are revolving around audio related which becomes the main feature of the application actually ? The audio quality is not bad after it starts working.
Very power hungry
Haven't used it yet
Good app
Good app! Sometimes it buffers more than I would like but I still use it daily.
It's a good image and essay user i like it!
Average
Loved it
It's good
Better than Skype which seems to have suffered some sort of slippage over the past few years. Lost a star however due to difficulty contacting support staff.
In Home Entertainment

It is fun. Be careful how you look or what is in your backdrop. Make it a nice experiance.
Very good app
Great app
using for stuck broker webinars
"Over all a strong app, however there needs to be more thought in how certain features are implemented. I admit I'm a new user of the app, however I found I had accidentally engaged an annotation feature when trying to unmute (I guess buttons overlay slightly or something?). Pressing back in android *did not* simply return you to your active meeting but rather to app settings it seems like. Worse yet, pressing back button from this screen rather than returning you to your active meeting dumps you to home screen (not hanging up thankfully) rather than sending you back to your active meeting. To me this is rather insane. I had legitimate issues getting myself unmuted in time for my turn in my meeting. Eventually after I ran some where else to offer my thoughts, walking back I found that there was a return to meeting button on the primary screen of settings, but the back button functionality is extremely poorly thought out."
"I want to record the meeting, how can I do it... please suggest"
This App is very useful for learners and schoolers .
good app
Audio didn't work. Had to call in.
Satisfactory
Thanks.
Cool

This app works very well.  However notifications on the phone and android wear would be better if you could see who the message was from and the message.  Also adding emojis would be nice.

First there was Skype. Now zoom is the next level video / business app.

"It is very important for me for haveing classmeeting at my house or my office. I hope this will be used by the other participants. Beside that Zoom Cloud Meeting can be used when we would like to discuss religion, social, culture, journal, research, article. These are not run well when we do not facilities like this application, so it is very important also this application shoud be socialized to another person to use for media for meeting. I think This application not only used a limited areas but all aspect of peolpe who use this application, I think that is all my opinion and ideas for this application Thank you very much"
This is awesome app. It's free and helpful for my classes
Bigger than Elvis
Excellent for running classes. Zoom is extremely intuitive and students particularly love the breakout rooms where they can collaborate in pairs or small groups. It is very customisable and can easily mamaged even with very large groups! I highly recommend it to all educators who need to have virtual classes.
OKE

"How can the average star rating be so low for this app? Zoom saved our bacon during the quarantine. Our office had never done remote work, and Zoom helped us not miss a beat. How this service continued without being brought to its knees by the sheer exponential usage boom I can't say, but the foundation to this service must have been very well planned for robust scalability. It's more than I deserve as a free user! I can't only recommend this, I have made it a part of day to day use. This is as fundamental a tool to our team as web browsers or email."
I use this to teach ss and it works so well. Thanks
I absolutely love this app. Its user friendly and its great when I have webinars for my business.
Great
Great
"Please make it available to home school teachers.  This was/is a valuable tool, and would love for my few students to be proficient in using.  I find it is great in preparing them for non traditional learning.  Please, please make available for those of us not in the classroom."
"The new white screen, ""class does not exist"" is irritating. not only that, but to get it back, you have give google access to your phone and data. not only is this wrong, but I absolutely refuse to do it. so I'm deleting it. Google classroom is just a convenience, and completely unnecessary to my school life."
"Completely rubbish will not let my son use his school email to use this app all his homework get sent to this which means he can not do it, y cant skools hand out homework like the use to,"

Always Error
Waste of time
I have one account. I shouldn't have to add another one. This is problay why you dont have good service.
Waste app
Google are scum. They run an almost complete monopoly on the internet. They can control what is on the internet
Who likes school?
Impossible to use on a phone
Shut up stupid notifications
How to enter into classroom because it's telling my no classroom account found even I am logged to my Google account
It sucks
Just another way to do hw.
The office season 5 episode 9
not bad
Very very bad... worst app really making a Google id only for a error message... just rubbish...
I was the 9th person to download this!!!!
Boo
"Can't login. says ""not a classroom account"""
the dumbest app i have ever downloaded
"ekdam bakkavas he ye app ,sing in karne k liye gmail account se nai hota he to q app  banaya kanasa account se kholrga ,apne kele se ,bakkwaass he yr ,          any person this application Google classroom please  Will be dose not download."
Yep
You can't even continue work with it
"""Just a sec"" turned out to be Just the rest of my life.  No matter how many times I try to log in, it just never loads. Well the ios works just fine. I  guess I'll be using That instead."
It is so boring like homework
It sucks
Horrible 😤
Haat
"I tried using ANY of my emails, I didn't work, then I tried using my school email which didn't work. Can someone help me please? I'd like to be able to use it."
I can't upload attached files. Fix it
slow af
Does not have the option to record audio. Annoyed.
Trash
No support or ability for those homeschooling to have their gmail or their domain recognised by Google to then allow usage of this app.
"Why did you develop this stupid good for nothing app . All it does is allow teachers,lecturers to dump some useless things on the students everywhere."
What a bad app ever I seee
It crashes 24/7 for me
"You can't even write in essays on the document, just not worth getting."
Bad quality
This app is way to hard to set up i used a million emails and none are working
Uu di
I just hate math class and my teacher uses this app so yeah
A piece of trash forces to do a new email refusing the existing one then after that it refused also asking for a new one in the same stupid cycle The fastest program to UNinstall
"This app does not work at all. When trying to sign in with my school email it says that my admin needs to activate Google Classroom. This is odd because we use Google Classroom inside of school, on laptops, plus I know others with the app and it works for them. Why?"
I haven't used it yet. But other user of this app thinks that it is not good and get the problems whit it.
Dose not work properly it is difficult to use because it won't let me get to the work or classrooms
Schoool
I think the people that wrought all those coments are stupidnm because there is not sutch names like that so u all stupid
"I really like google classroom and I fine it very helpful with my studies, but the app doesn't do the site justice. Most if time time it doesn't load or doesn't bring up my classes."
The app would not let me continue on an email and kept saying I needed an admin permission just to join a class.
Can't even try to get to my class
kms
Cannot add students.
When a teacher ask a mcq question then teacher can only see how many students answer which option but teachers cant see who answers which options.. this must be improved
Happy
It wont let me login saying my admin hasnt activated tge classroom yet and obviously it has also it wont let me get into the docs my teacher puts up in the classroom i am very frustrated and upset rn
I have   Google classroom account but I have to make a new account it's stupid
IT WON'T DOWNLOAD AND I NEED IT IN 2 DAYS HELP
Why make us students download? WHY?
"Was hoping to use this for tutoring, but i guess i have to build my own school in order to use this. Google Apps why you always make peoples lives difficult?"
This is slowly ruining my life.
Bye App
"It works, kindof, it doesn't display all of the imformation on an 
assignment and sometimes doesnt show all the assignments. I was so confused 
with an assignment i had to do until i went onto classroom on pc and saw 
the full description. Idk if it is a bug or just a bad UI but please fix it."
It doesnt work
M not able to submit my assignment s
Why can't I😡😵
Hate it because of my teacher
Wherever I go to upload videos to it it laods for a bit then stops... WITH NOTHING THERE. It works alright with photos but videos never work😡
I didn't let me sign in and I had the right info
Can't install
How to found class code
I should have slept for the last half an hour instead of trying to figure out this app.
"it worked fine and then it started not getting my notifications now i uninstalled it and reinstalled it then it said ""you cant use this account"" or something, please fix this bug! my teachers will get mad!"
it sucks

BAD
"Bro, I'm just tryna get rid of online school. I mean... it is what it is"
It is bad
Okay so first of all i get over 100 notifications for no reason like is it trying to be anoying. This app is honestly the worst app ive ever used. It is so unorganized and its so anoying because of all the notifications i get. It never lets me log in when i need to and never lets me even get on the app. The app is so bad. Take it down please:).
It wont let me login through my phone..
this app has crumbled away any sanity i had left. my mental health is deteriorating day by day due to google classroom. my mind will forever be broken.
"After updating to the latest version, I am been removed from my enrolled classes and afterwards when i try to reinstall it, it says not able to sign in"
"Vaya mrd de app, se me traba cada 2 x 3 y ahora no me deja entrar en ninguna clase"
"During this very uncertain time, Google should stop being greedy and careless about mental health of children and stop offering this app, as education is hard to do now. Although it may help us learn something, most things won't even stick with us. Teachers assign tons and tons of things, but we can barely even learn, as meany of us are extremely stressed out. Suicide rates will increase dramatically, and many students will just outright refuse to do the work. During this time, we should all be with our families, and not doing some school work while our friends, relatives and other people we know are dying."
Can't do anything
Horrible app it scams you would give it negitve stars if I could
take it down
When i got on i choked and almost died
Terrible
I hate how I get way to much and like who do you think you are giving me this much work to do like i'm trying to do some homework and all of a sudden there is another lesson and it due some day like maybe for like tomorrow and I just got it I would like it is I would have a week like who do they think they are giving me so much homework but I mean it would be good if we did not get so much homework but I mean this is what I think and we all have different opinion.

"Teachers cannot comment on student work, in the app, like they can on the web, so what is the point?  Students can receive assignments (so 2 stars for a 1 star app), but when they click on a doc, it only opens in a browser, even if a corresponding Google app is installed! Have you ever tried to edit a Google doc on a mobile browser?  Ouch!   And why do I have to get an email for comments that appear in ""stream""?  We have enough duplication of effort in school already, thanks."
"I couldn't use the app on a previous version because it gave me disclaimers that my info was outdated. And i couldn't update the app, so I deleted it and re-downloaded it. but now i can't even log in without the screen saying ""We are sorry, but you do not have access to classroom, I've used Google Classroom on my phone before and I need it for school and can't even use it. please fix this issue."
"Why if i try to attach file from attach files in smartphone i can't even post it, it always says 'make sure your file is in your devices', i can't hand in my homework from smartphone, very annoying, please fix the attach from smartphone, my friends also experience the same way, btw i use redmi 4"
It is terribly slow! I tried to take pictures of my work to send to my teacher and it took a very long time to load.
"Do I really need to create another google account for educational purposes instead of just using my main google account? What happen to ""One Account, All of Google""? Pls fix this. If possible, is it ok if you can add a setting for linking accounts like Facebook, Twitter, etc.? This can really help. Thank you"
"i would like you to improve the app more by making the files of higher file size to upload in a manner that shows aloading bar instead of showing up a loading animation, how many times have i been uploading files and that it always tend to get cancelled every time i accidently tap the screen! its really frustrating as it always got me failed my due dates because of this. please do allow this suggestion as it could really help alot of students like me having this type of problem. Fix it!"
It says that my admin didn't activate Google classroom but they did...
always stop working 🙄
how to log out my account
"U say one account for everything , but this is asking another account... Plzz fix this..:("
Can't connect with Google it keeps on displaying ' Not a classroom account'
Too much work involved to create a Google apps education account.
It wont let me log in for some reason!
Big brother for the classroom

My daughter was doing some work for science and she got and D- . Please help now Google Classroom please. We're going to tell this to my friends just please help this for other kids who have get a D- .
It won't let me sign into my school account
Lnd
"I use classroom with my students, but the app is useless because I store the classroom handouts on the about tab which is not accessible from the app."
I can't join the classrooms
"It will not let me sign in! It says ""can't connect. check if you're online"". I have tried to do it using both 4g and connecting to WiFi but it still doesn't work.I am also on android if that makes a difference. Someone please help!!!! I need to use this for my homework assignments but the website is annoying!"
how can i create google classroom id
i keep trying to download the update. and in order for it to work I have to delete everything on my phone
How to sign it
"The teacher sent me the class code, but it doesn't work.  Multiple teachers at 2 different schools, so it can't be wrong codes.  HELP"
Badddfddddd
Can sign in with my account
Ok ok
Well it really takes away the fun of not doing the assignment on time and standing out of the class. So listen to Hollywood undead and sleep tight don't let the dead bite.
Yyyy
i can't submit my work.. after i turn in it shows work not submitted.. respond asap
The app suddenly stopped working and says classroom needs to be activated on the account. But it's only a problem on the app.
"All the great options for teachers do not work on this app.  Great if we can review and grade the job of our students, we be able to wok everything as the computer for teachers and students."
"it keeps saying ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again. Google please respond"
Update is not effective especially after the new Classwork tab. And it is unable to show me published posts. Please fix it!
Android ➡ Lollipop 🍭
Love you
"Horrible. I can't see the materials that I can see on the computer. The layout of everything is so much more complicated and unnecessary, for the phone and the computer. It was a bad change."
I like it but it's not letting my student login cause the code won't work please fix ASAP cause I don't want to get fired 🔥
Won't update. Error 505. Only app that won't update. 5x user.
I used to be able to see my classes but now i cant see anything it says i do not have access to my own account and that i have to get help by my provider? Tried uninstalling and re installing did nothing.
It keeps on telling me to update and the things my teacher posted aren't showing up
Pretty much dosent work
It asking me a account for that I give it 2 stars like there
"When I tried to sign in with my district account, it said I had to have a Google school account which I don't have. The only way I can access it is when I use it via Chrome"
"Every time I try to log in, it says to ask the administrator for access. It used to work but now it doesnt seem to let me on mobile. Anything that's not mobile, It works. Idk why but I really need this to work on mobile."
I have a Nh mansd account and it won't let me use my account because it has to be a Gmail account
"This app is advertised to use about 10mb of space on my phone.  But after installing it, it takes up 25."
communism will rise
I don't understand the purpose of this app. I can't grade using this app. I can't respond to students' comments. I have to go to the Google classroom website on a laptop or a computer to do the above.
I cant seem to log into my school
Well in my pc works perfect but on my phone i cant even sign in
"I signed in with my schools email and uninstalled the app(So I could get rid of the notification about signing in again for my school email, which I don't know my school email's password), now I can't get back in."
Tried a student account and wouldn't let me in 😣😣🙅🙅
It wouldn't let me sign into my class.  I personally think that you should use this on a computer and don't get this as an app it is not worth your time.😠😠😑😑
😍😍
Everytime I open this app I know I have to work.
Not usefull at all
"It said I needed an upgrade but, it did not show it when I pressed the play store button to upgrade"
It's not to nice
I don't like it
It never really works for me when I need to submit
When trying to authenticate it won't say what to type it just shows up blank please fix I'm using the note 4 and I'm running kitkat 4.4.4
"Helpful app, but it does not show newly added contents in folders of my classes. However, it does show in my computer, but not in the app."
I had to uninstall Google Classroom because it wasn't allowing me to view recent assignment uploads. I tried to redownload and now it isn't allowing me back in with my school account. I'm not sure what to do.
Needs to let us use the Google docs and files my teachers put on there
Boring....Can't you add still new features????
I need to catch uo=p on school work and it says that we need a class code.what are we suposed to do Email are teacher and ask for the class code!I mean we could do that But thats to much work.Well I cand understand why.I mean what if Some one that isint in that class trys to get into that class.
how many student googleclassroom can invited. I cannot invited more 300 plus.
"This doesn't download my files from my school classes for my project🙅 DO NOT GET THIS APP Oh by the way, I'm in 7th grade"
One thing that bugs me the most is: To download a file whether it's a PDF/Word/PPT always I have to click every single one of them and open it either in my phone's(or open a new window in the PC browsers) WPS/Office software and then only I can save it or download it... Why isn't there any options that you can just have a download button below or to the side and we can just tap or click on them to open up. No joke Google. It's too annoying. Don't waste our times like that. Change it.
Unless you share the same domain with your students there is no point of this app. Please fix this asap
"I downloaded the app purely because my teacher called me just to let me know she sent me homework. thanks, google. update: the app wont even download"
I would give you 5ive stars but it deleted all my classed when I got the new update.
Doesnt work on mobile data
"I've been using google classroom for 2 years but yesterday suddenly it stopped working. I've tried to log in but it keeps on says ""try to ask your admin to activate your google classroom. Could you help please? Thanks"
happy
I have to enter my password
"Thanks for giving and serving this Google, though: Whenever my buddies and I are doing an assignment: It'll wipe all our junk if we forget to save or the internet messes up.."
Go
I didnt get any class code from where i will get class codes
Why cant I just us my school account on the app insted of having to add a whole new account  to my tablet
"I am using various google apps, like maps, gmail, youtube, play store, google play, etc. With the email address, I am logged in my device, but this app is not allowing me to sign in with those ids. It comes up that I am not having id for google education service, pls help. How to get rid of this problem. If it worked I will surely give it 5 star like I have given to rest of the corporate's products. Thanks"
"With the latest version I'm not sure if there is a bug but I can't access 
files or any type of documents my teachers share with me"
"I need this app for school but it refuses to work! I have work to do and this drives me up the wall! Fix it and leave it, don't add stupid stuff that causes it to crash and stop working. It puts me in panic mode because I have to log on for my hw and I'm greeted with a message that I can't log in. It works on computers, but I don't have constant access, so it makes things difficult. Not happy."
It works but it has a lot of issues.
"The app fails to update it's information, I can't see any of my new coursework"
Why i cant attach a file? It keeps loading and loading
Can't use without being a school. We homeschool.
The new way its updated makes it to where I can no longer access the assignments my teachers post to classroom. It was fine the way it was.
"Giving it 2 stars because it works on computer, but for my phone it literally is unusable, everytime I load a class, it says ""info outdated, please try again."" P.S: I have updated the app."
"Keeps saying to upgrade,then clicked to upgrade and nothing. Stays in upgrade loop will not let me access."
I download the app. Then when ask to sign in with my school account. A pop up will show with my google account and add account. I want to add my school account.It then prompt me to enter my current password that I use to unlock my phone. I enter my password. And it won't let me move on.
I've been using Google classroom for a while now and it is a great app but I recently just upgraded to a galaxy s6 and put the app on the phone and I immediately encountered a problem. I can load up my assignments but for some reason I can't edit them. Whenever I press the edit button it just brings up another copy of the assignment and won't let me edit.  Pls  fix this problem it really just makes the app useless for me.
Would be great if I got notifications whenever my professor makes a comment for the class.
I have created a new account yet the app says it isn't a classroom account??!! Someone please help!
This app is kind of a glitchy mess hlf the time i click hand in and it doesnt really hand in.
eehh
"When I try to open assignments in the app, it tells me my classes don't exist. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but when I tried to sign in, I got a message saying that I did not have access."
Allows easy tutor and student affair in terms of grading.
"Please make it so that device policy dosent have to be installed to use this app. Google dosent make it so that it has to do this on iPhones so please make this work on android. By downloading this app I think I would give my school a way to wipe my phone, and I think it does something so that I cant see notifications. I get this for school owned devices but please make away to opt out for personal ones. But the app itself is proably pretty good I've used the web app and it was pretty good."
Not good
The app is turning black when i attach files for submission :(
"Not able to access anything on school account, please help!"
Add private comment overlapped the hand in button in Android version. It's really pissed me off
Before the update the app was perfect but after the new update whenever i enter any class it shows to me (something went wrong) and then gets me out of the class and now i cant join any class
"After the last update like everyone has been saying, there is a fish icon and I can't see my work for my classes."
My google classroom is shout down. I can't access content of the App.
great app but suddenly All my classes r gone after the update. What happened? Now it's asking me for class codes.
"Latest update kicked me out of all my classes and I cannot access them on my phone, only my computer."
"I just got removed from all of my classes, and I cannot explain why. Maybe my account got deleted."
"My classroom account was left involuntarily and unable to join again using the invite code. It said sorry, something went wrong"
Worked great before and then one day I clicked on my classes and it kicked me out of those classes.
it keeps logging me out of classes on my phone
Surprised you cannot customize notifications
I cannot start the app.
Got kick from my classroom and couldnt get in anymore
Can't open the Google drive and login
why i seeing fish logo under google classrom. I can't get in my classes as well
Stopped work
"Recently updated to the new version and was unable to see some of my classes, tried to reinstall but there was an error and couldn't sign in to my account. Help would be appreciated!"
"After updating the app, I got a notification from a class and then a I clicked on it and I was kicked out of that class. I then tried to go to other classes and it kicked me out of those as well. Any help would be appreciated."
I just got removed from the classroom after a 🐟 like symbol that appeared on the icon of the app...plz help
Upgraded to this new 'confidential' version and I can't access the classes that I was part of.
I am not able to log onto the latest version
cant add account.
"Normally I have a good experience with this app but today the app became ""confidential"" and proceeded to kick me out of all of my classes. I need those classes all of my homework is in there and it is due on Monday and most of my teachers are not gonna care that classroom isn't working. I want it fixed now ir I am going to sue for messing up my grades because colleges are looking at my grades and I could lose money for that."
"Ever since i updated the aap , I'm not able to login. What do i do?"
"I went into google classroom this morning because it had a fish symbol on it and when I did, it told me this version of google classroom was not yet released to public and when I proceeded to click on one of my classrooms it told me an error had occurred and then it deleted it. Now I don't have two of my most important classes. Care to explain?"
It says couldn't add account to classroom
I uninstalled the app because I wasn't seeing some of my classes and now it's saying that I can't log in to my account.
I gave it 2 stars because it won't let me sign in on the app but it does on the web. So that most definitely sucks. 👎🏿👎🏿☹️💔😢
good
it
"I have had countless problems with this app over the past 6 months. Some audio files wouldn't play while others would. In an attempt to fix the bug I uninstalled then reinstalled the app - now it's saying I can't sign in using the email I have been signed in with for the past 4 years. I'm tired of this app, and if I didnt need it for school I would not use it."
Develop it more
thank you very much ar. I can see my teacher every day
"Kind of mid, for turning in school work it takes way too long to upload kb pictures. I have to upload 10+ and it takes forever."

Allows my son to connect to school and complete homework however he is struggling to log in via his phone via his account connected to mine as a family link which is quite annoying.

Tk ada pa maklumat
This is really a bad app which I have never seen. It is used for my school purpose but I am not abled to complete within the time given.
Vfu
"I haven't been able to get on this app always says something went wrong , it worked the first few months and then it just randomly stopped"
Nice app
Ff
Very good app for help all students &also teachers

The app is very useful but sometimes the app is not show the class comments and time of comment.
it won't let me launch and says i do not have access to classroom
It works But the loading is Just No terrible
Why cant i save my work!? Not cool google . NOT cool
Not letting me do things Fix please an thank you
"When I am working in my work , It glitches me out of my work before I could even save it and I have to do it over and over again. At first I thought it was good but after I triggered this bug soooooo many times , I just want to say...GOOGLE DISAPPOINTED ME!"
The classroom is not responding properly although the network is so fast i need study but its not opening
"I very frustraded.... I cant check my overall average in my classes like i can on my computer or an iphone. PLEASE FIX THIS. As a top student im very concerned with my grades being at a specific level, however i cannot check my average on my android, but i can on a computer."
It stops working all the time on my phone saying 'something went wrong please try again' or 'you are not enrolled in this class' or just kicks me out of my account and won't let me back on
I gave away a password and now it says I do not have access to the app. I can not go on. Do not download.
"It wants me to request permissions for basically anything, and is impossible to use because of it. As a student, I'd say if you need to look at files for the most part use a different app or opt for the website."
"Our teacher told us to log into our accounts on our phones if we wanted to, our own personal emails won't work with Google classroom and it says that they are invalid, there is no option to sign in with an existing account, if there was I would easily be able to sign into my school account with my schools email they set up for me. Could this be added please?"
"Whenever I try to attach a document from the phone , it shows couldn't attach drive files. It happens everytime and i have to upload everything on drive to attach the file. Please find the fix soon."
The app downloaded to a phone that I did not choose and can't use. no way to delete and install on my laptop.
doesnt let me join a classroom
Amazing
There should be download option to study offline.
It takes more time to load the ppt ........ These problem comes only now a days .....last verson was good than this..... The updates are bad
Hi! Since this morning I'm not able to open the editing student document option on my android tablet. It just opens it on googledrive documents (I'm astonished as until this morning everything worked out perfectly...any ideas?)
"not pretty good, simply it doesn't have messaging feature, and the students can't choose the privacy of what they post on the wall!!"
My teacher made me get this and i dislike her so I'll take it of on the app for no real some reason
Good
Good aps
It keeps constantly closing on me saying it isnt responding when i try scrolling
"I try to add an account (that being my child's) but the first thing it asks for is a password, not a email, but a password. My password doesn't work and neither does my child's."
it is very helpful to me
Doesn't update grades in-app but will send notifications of grade updates.
Allow student with gmail account can join Educational account group. Add attendance option in the group which can be exported to Google sheet and list of student can be imported from google sheet.
I am getting error that closed the app
Ok
"Due to lack of internet service It is unable to download the documents .....and sometimes it is not possible to submit our assignments it displays"" sorry something goes wrong"".😢"

My app is not working since 5th August.So i uninstalled than restalled it but now msg showed contact to ur domain administrator.One more question that can we use this app on different mobiles with same id's?
"Good app indeed, however for this past few days the apps doesnt work, everytime i try to send my work it say ""work doesnt send"" or ""there an error occured"""
"For some reason i have to do this action and i have sync errors, what is this problem?"
Hassan
Not getting notifications. I only downloaded it to get notifications. I have to check them each time like in the website!
"I really like the app, my big complaint is that you can not track attendance and behavior as well. Forcing you to use somethibg else anyway."

This app should have widgets!!
I submits assignments and work done
3 stars because of school
Asf
It's a way for teachers to get out of teaching and let the internet teach. I myself hate it but some of my classmates like it. But it dosnt make 8th grade any easier. 😣
It won't connect because the info might be outdated. Anyone with an answer to why my app is doing this please let me know
Wow good job!!!
How do you upgrade
"I put in my classroom email and nothing happened. So I put in my information for nothing, but I had other electronics to use so it was ok."
"When a post is long, it doesn't open. Sometimes tapping on the post multiple times does the job, sometimes doesn't. It makes the mobile app pretty much unusable. Also, please include a dark mode."
"I could access the assignments I had given to my classes until I myself joined a class created by admin. Now, all I can see is assignments I am given, not those for the classes I run. I had hoped that the updates would address this bug... I have submitted feedback repeatedly on this issue. Please fix."
"Hi Google, I have tried logging in with my Gmail ID but it is not accepting! Please fix it."

Thanks hh
It's ok
Pls Fix your bug about the internet
I love googles tools a lot. I have. Student account but my school uses more apple tools. I would love if it was possible to use the tool even without a class code
It should let my parents *She had the app in 5th grade* still use there apps like Facebook and YouTube correctly instead of blocking them out
Since last update I cant open the app
I cannot send my work
"good for school, but could have more options for students"
It's a good app but it doesn't work on the smartphone
Do i need wifi on it ?
dark mode for the love of God!!
"I actually love this app. But since a few days ago, it can't let me post any files from my file manager as assignments to any tasks given by my teachers. Please fix this problem, then I'd like to add more star(s). Thank you!"
When you go into app it says to update it now but when we tap on update button play store opens and we got to know that it is already updated .This is happening repeatedly.
What is the class code?? I don't get it
I am a beautiful and I be in the uk
"I'm a 7th grader using my dad's email or account and I just have a question, How do you log into your school account? On my tablet, it won't let me."

"Notifications seem broken, only showing a blank notification from the app, no details whatsoever. Maybe it's an app bug, or just an incompatibility error with Oreo."
App can be better. Whenever i open some document sended to me it says connect to the interest even it is connected . Please help my exams are near
It keeps saying I need an upgrade ?? But it doesn't need to be updated I've uninstalled it too and it says the same
Forms that are made for classroom are to be opened in browser pls fix that
"Hey I saw this app get patented by Elon Rood in May 2014, as PIXUS LIGHTNING EDUCATOR. Where did you get the idea for this? You havent finished the invention. All the low income children of the world need thier Educator. Thier portable classroom you made so well. If you are going for the gold get to steppin'. Enjoy!"
Nice
trash
Add an option to sign in without granting admin rights to domain owner
"There is a problem with opening attachments on mobile. Please fix this is 
makes it hard to use."
Eh it's whatever I only ever use it for school Work en Stuff
I can't get rid of labels from my classes in google calendar.
being able to have students alphabetcal by last name on the android app would be VERY helpful. Would make entering and sbumtting grades much easier
awesome but I hope google implements the ability to download the attachments because that's how our professors give notes
Ok
it did not work for me
It keeps people on the computer so much to do their work their eyes start to hurt and get headaches. This is just promoting more online work.😐😕
I like using it when I need too.
Caprice please teach me how to use
It won't work
"It slow, but its good"
It wont let me on ggggrrr but if i use a computer it fine
It's ok
Well at least i can now do computer work at home on my tablet
"Google class,"
It's ok ...I like it
Google classroom is a great tool. The app has difficulty updating the stream.
My admin has accepted me to use it but it says my admin hasn't I use it at school and have no problems but I can not use this on my phone
ok
It says I need to upgrade it to use it but I don't know how???

It is okay

Won't work anymore was great when it did work though.
Visual book
It's fine
"Not very impressive, just a simple copy of my homework app and I prefer the latter."
why is it taking too long to download it
It ok
"I cant see recent feed from my teacher,other than me everyone can see the feed.Please fix this issue."
Never loading
Why cant i used my gmail account that have already exist on my device ??
Nice idea... Really a grt app..But still many things to be introduced. Like whenever there is a number. It should be linked with related information. Summary of an assignment should be linked to students profile and many more
Its ok i guess just need to do my work peace.
"You can stay on top of things it, cool"
It's good
Great for learn on the way from classroom
It is OK
It Would be nice if one can add a particular playlist of videos from Youtube instead of adding videos one by one. Just paste a link to a playlist and then the videos get added automatically.
Beep beep lettuce
It was helpful
I installed it and is going to show to my teacher but at sign in it says i m not registered for it im confused how to do that
"I need it, so it really doesn't matter either. I guess it's okay ,I haven't tried yet."
Warriors blew a 3-1 lead
"Plz add download option for the doc,ppt files"
"I used to love this app until they removed the ""to-do"" screen. My son and I would use that screen to see all of his assignments and due dates in one place."
"Great idea for a classroom platform.  I wish there was support for markdown language, so that teachers can format content in a consistent way, which would be especially useful when teaching programming and for command line examples. I look for you this platforms future releases."
ANTI THEFT ALARM APP
Take away the ability for teachers to look at work when it isn't submitted. It was infuriating when my teacher 'marked' my work when the assignments deadline wasn't even near.
I cant log in
Fabeuook
Eh
It tells me to update even though my phone updates automatically
Its cool but don't life like school like that
Last update was not working properly and hanging
So much storage
Not so great if you're a teacher. Let me know when the teacher functionality is accessible from the app.
Its ok
"I personally think. The world is leaping towards online education.  Google classroom is a good concept but live interaction with the class is needed. Google Hangouts implements this without a whiteboard facility and with a limitations to interact with only 10 live participants. If Google classroom is a educational technology Google needs to provide a video conferencing capability within it, with at least 50 students, or a webinar capability with a larger group. Teachers needs to leave Google platforms to other sources for this requirements. I hope Google will implement such a facility soon. At a genuinely affordable cost."
I could get to stuff but it would not let go into some videos or slides
Well its ok
It should for everyone who actually have to use it.
Its not a bad app or anything. Its just OK!👌
What happens to the materials? I cant see them here from the app. Web is fine.
Google classroom help's me and alot of other students with work... Don't need any hard copies and all on your laptop or desktop.
"It should add tagging options, notifications and pop telling teachers that a newer and better version is available (if so)."
helpful
It won't let me sign in. Fix it and I'll give u more stars
"I love google classroom. It's a great service. However, the app is unable to connect to the classrooms. this means that the app will not show me the most recent posts from my classes."
We can't change the class theme photo on tablets. Please fix?
"Slow, confusing, and plain update"
"Other than the fact that now i cant use and check it because it said my 
info is out of date and i cant go in and change it"
Takes to long to download in my school but is a gud app.
"I was just expecting a timetable, but it asks for a school code. Does my school even have one???"
Sucks
How do I sign up for education classroom..do reply
It's not fun.
"Meh, just for school, but it helps to be on my phone"
The notifications aren't going through to my phone. Very inconvenient since i depend on my notifications for new assignments added.
"Well... I diddnt give it full because of how complicated it is, also I had a few problems too :\"
It's good
Ok
Features such as class chat could be added. I finished a task and submit it but  display shows that i have not done it yet.
"The app is pretty good, but I wish that it would auto-detect due dates in announcements, because teachers leave announcements which don't show up as assignments and it leads to me missing things they post. Also, the app requires that you click the name of the person who made the post to open the post, which is kinda annoying. I just want to click anywhere on the post to open it. I'd also like the ability to add a classmate's email to a contact by tapping on their name in the ""Classmates"" section"
"It's very annoying and inconvenient that it won't synch with already established Gmail accounts. I have many students who are confused as to how they need to log in and join up. I'll admit I'm confused too because I can't help them. Everytime I try to join a class to see what the problem is, I get an error message stating that I don't have access to this app. What is going on? How are they supposed to sign up/join if the site won't even acknowledge them!"
updated the app and it won't show my classes
Every time I try to login it aays I'm not connected to the Internet even though I am. .. fix this please
Good
Its a good app
In a world where your forced to download dis app by teachers
You guys should fix the login because I tried logging in ad I don't see my account
what do you think if your a stuent then yeah pretty boring guess what im a student to but.. its good and helpful app that helps you get your homework done
Takes forever to do load
"Very useful .,......"
Why cant I attach a file and send it to the group
It's a good appb
"It keeps on saying ""We are sorry, but you do not have access to Classroom. Please contact your domain administrator for access.""  I can't access my classes on app, but tried it on browser and it worked. Please do something about this. Thank you."
it ok
"The app contains a bug, I can't open the attached PPT files when I press on 
the file, I had to try pressing on several places to find the right 
position on the screen to be able to open it."
Helpful but drains battery like crazy
It's stupid
I 'm verry impress by this app . it is a very usefull for teachers & students also
Please make a button to leave classroom
Not bad
Thia app helps the students to get the assignment and all the other things .It also helps to get the doudts clear by lectures .The users gets the notification in mail .The last date fir aby assignment or work given by teachers.
Good
Like it
"This app never works from my device, even when I updated it, I was unenrolled from all classes and now I can't get back in them."
I think it is cool because u can talk to your teachers on here
i can do assignments
Ok
doesn't give any notifications
Design or system is not good
It's not the best but it is Ok
"It's ok good for the parents if they concern about they child in P\G\S\D or go to any school located here in pascagoula ms ""Thanks"""
What if my school don't use it but i want to? It seems interesting so i want to try. Is it possible?
I use it on my laptop but I cant use it on here keeps shutting off
Does it require data. Connection to start
Good app but still need lots of features
"After the upgrade, i cant find the Pen symbol anymore"
"This is Important 1. The App doesn't allow us to Archive or Delete the Class. If the app is unable to do such ! Then, what's the Advantage or Profit in Installing the App !! Plus it doesn't provide the additional features like Changing the Theme, etc."
"I love most things Google!  However, being unable to reply to students' questions, etc. makes it difficult to have collaborative conversations or to give immediate feedback to students.  This app doesn't have all of the easy-to-use features that are on desktop, and that means my students are running into the same limitations. I hope that it will be improved soon!  I am using the app on a Samsung Tab 8A if that makes any difference."
Well it's good FOR MY TEACHER TO POST HOMEWORK nah jk its good
Its ok but I dont always find my assignments but when I was using i my computer it worked
This app keeps crashing every month.
Work
"Makes me think of school, which makes me sad :,("
I think it is okay but it does not allow people to create their own classrooms which is not right. It is not effective if we cannot create classrooms
Why not make just a social one. Maybe your not a student or teacher but you want to communicate with you friends?? Or just want to do it for fun. I really suggest it.
Specialist
Good
I would give this a 5 but it doesn't work with my school email when online I can log into my email just fine.
"The notification for new assignment is never show up. I know new assignment after i got new email. I use asus zenfone 5, please fix it. Thanks"
I think it is ok   To
"Google Classroom is very helpful in terms of turning in assignments. However, it has flaws. When I try to create any sort of google doc, slide, spreadsheet, or pdf as an attachment, the app attaches some sort of space that the only option is to draw on. This is super frustrating, so everytime I have to attach a document, I have to separately go into google docs, name it my unnecessarily long assignment title, write the assignment, and switch back to classroom to attach and submit it. Not good."
lost app
It's a good thing to use on computer but on my phone it always says I can't connect right now try again later does anyone know how to solve this?
u
"I really hate this app, it's so great, it can't help me do my work, and i use it all the time. YEET"
Other than this not only night nice atl
bhoot zada slow hay
it is good know
This app takes a high space so I couldn't able to download it
Hey .. plz is there a version for PC !
Good app and usefully for all others
Osm
Still a long way to go
The class is having bug! Our teacher created assignment on 9:30 am and deadline to submit it is 2:00 am of same day...how one can able to set deadline before creating assignment 🤔.... Don't you think you have to fix this...
Once the weird glitch thing was fixed I got back in my classes and everything became normal pretty good app
"App will let me open things and write my answers, but the second I want to turn something in the private comment bar blocks it, preventing me from turning it in. Please fix this"
I wasn't able to see the class I really needed to submit my report to... Pls halp
"About the new updated version, after i updated gg classroom i couldnt acess. Fix that bug, plz"
"After the update I was kicked out of my classes. But, I deleted and installed google classroom twice, and it worked and brought my classes back. If ur having trouble u should try this. If this doesnt work I dont know what else to do. I hope this works for you."
Recently it has stopped allowing be to open documents and I'm not sure why.
Meh. not that great nothing to say about it
Is a great app before it had a fish icon (?) I googled it up and it says that I have developer mode. Please let me have regular classroom back!
"I've been removed of every classroom that I was in when I clicked on them. I hope this won't repeat because the classes contain materials that I need. And if possible, get me back into these classes."
Why is this version of classroom suddenly confidential?? I honestly have no clue what is going on-
Good
"No attendance taking option, No pinned post option, No way to highlight a post. There's a option to pick on students but none for taking attendance. How is that possible?"
"We need more options, I think about live session with connected students."
Add Share options and more features..
Need improvements
Hard to find out homework schedule for some teachers because it's another thing to do in the real classroom
Cannot handle excess Data
It's always giving notifications and it's annoying me.
Can't open or delete archived classes ...
Is glitching
School is very hard.
Good
Bug everywhere
Notification management should be a thing. I would want a feature where you could choose if you want to receive a notification for a class (an assignment for example) an hour before it's due. Not a day before.
Very nice app
Good
Everything was fine but now it doesnt even show my classes. I cant turn in a huge assignment that is almost 10 precent of my grade
The idea is good but Google needs to design a new whole way to organize the classroom. In this version it looks messy.
It wont let me sign in into my Google account I use at school they need to get this fixed!
All school started to use this app... So i hope i can works properly with read or unread notifications
"Not bad, it's good for school anyways."
need more features
It told me I has to upgrade it and it never upgraded so I could not use ir at all on this device.
Need an option for sending to others
My teachers are annoyong
Good
Dark mode please
"Well I don't know it my phone or the app.But everytime I try to add my school account,it says Couldn't communicate with Google server. I tried using 'bout a month but still can't.Pls reply."
Sometime Uploaded files & links aren't accessible to students.
Ta bugado mas é funcional
It's very good because i work on him.
"I'm using this app for homeschooling, and for the most part, it does help a lot with organization. However, grading quizzes is a bit cumbersome. I create the quiz in the Drive, then attach it in Classroom; the student takes the quiz in the Drive and marks it done in the Classroom; I go back into the Drive to retrieve the grade, then go back to Classroom to record it. Surely there's an easier way?"
"I use my gmail account in signing in to google classroom but Whenever i tried adding a new account, it keep asking about a code. Idk, where can i find the code. Please help me what to do."
Fine I guess
There must be an option to attach document in comment....
Ok
Good
Its ok
"This is a great app! I use it all the time because I'm in school. However, there is this bug that says I have no internet connection when I do. It stops me from checking class work and makes the app unusable. Sadly, it happens a lot of times as well so it's quite annoying. Please fix this! Thank you in advance!"
Frequently crashes.
It is very good app
It's a good way for not wasting paper. And it also helps you keep track of your stuff unlike paper there's absolutely no way to lose it
Sometimes doesn't let me access
good
"IT NEVER WORKS AT ALL FOR ME, but i am useing a phone so that may have something to do with it."
Reeeeeeeeee
"It's still OK, but when I have another account, it always tells me to verify the account"
"I give three stars because only teachers can upload content if student can upload some content like pdf , jpgs etc. Then it will be more better than current version........."
It helps people poop good in the toilet when like is tough 💩
Very help to all my duty
"Hmmm... sorry but, I was gonna rate 5 stars but, uh, I was expecting for it to be like the Google Classroom from the school's Chromebooks and I use a Samsung Galaxy Tab A. Sorry."
Im I 8
My one doesn't work
Is the apps can be open from multiple device using same account..?
"I don't know why, but right after the latest update, I didn't get any notifications when my lectures send notes or homework."
"Very useful one, updates for students amd parents is a must these days, keep rocking."
"Don't understand!! App is great but then I try to edit my work and I can't!! I can't work on it on the go, even though I am on 4G!! Please fix this Google!!"
slow app
its nice but sometimes it takes more time to open files
It is rally good
Awesome
i wanted to send my powerpoint output on my PR2 subject and ended up not sending it coz the app won't accept my work. I am thinking that it should be good this second time I'm using this one.
"I tried to record a video from Google classroom and we saved,just because it can't upload on the assignment now its gone."
I did not get to make a comment on this app to show that we completed the homework that was given
Good
"New for me, not yet familiar with it"
Its cool
Pls tell me how to download digital teks book
It help full
It is helpful for my exams but it uses wifi
Not bad
Moderate
You guys need to add the edit function in comment box.
Gng
"It works really good most of the time, but the second I try to use it on my phone I ""dont have access"". So weird and unacceptable."
Hate school
No notification of anything even though I enabled them in app AND phone settings
I prefer the old version of classroom it's more accessible
Sangat baik
How to submit my assignment. There's no option for that. Please fix it soon.
"Still learning, so far pretty helpful."
It would be better if there was a date posted on assignments because I got an F on a late assignment I got done within the late spectrum of when I could post it in late. And the teacher doesn't beleive me.
"When a post is long, it doesn't open. Sometimes tapping on the post multiple times does the job, sometimes doesn't. It makes the mobile app pretty much unusable. Also, please include a dark mode."
"Actually according to what i've heard about it, it use to be a great app and maybe when i get over it, i will rate it much better i guess."
Crashes when i switched account
Too slow
Nice app
Need to just add a search option so that files or name of the person who send the file can be searched without that it takes time to find the person and name of the old file.
"Great concept and all, but a can't create a new account without inserting some PIN code to ""verify identity"". I haven't heard of any code I need to know for making a NEW ACCOUNT. Please tell me what kind of code that is."
So times it works some times it does not
It involves school
this app won't let me log in!!!!!! and I can log in on other devices!!!! it is really frustrating!
I can't open attachment file for assignment.
it should be has a option to tagging someone when reply a chat.
Job description

Nice
Best app. For students
very helpful to keep up with school classes but freezes here and there and something keeps saying try again on most classes on refresh.
I already had an account i put it in and the app would not let me use that now i have to turn in work late dont get this app also i got it a year ago and it did the same thing
Cant open documents...
"I like and use classroom a lot but every time I try to join into a class or go into a class assignment I can't because it always says ""Something went wrong please try again"". Please help."
Bauppq
"Mine was error this all day, my connection are just fine"
Not bad
Np
Its annoying that you need to still install google docs and slides why can it all just be done google classroom
It was pretty good the only thing i did not like was that it would not let me in sorry if this messes up your repution but i just had to say it well have a good day.
Was good until the app stopped accepting my email. I now have to wait until I have access to my computer before I can open Google Classroom.
Could make downloading a pdf a little more easier.
Good
"I can use this just fine on my class chromebooks, but I tried to download it on my tablet, and I logged in with my school account and it says ""You do not have access to google classrooms."" I'm not saying the site is bad, but I want to know why this isn't working, send help please ; - ;"
Fair
Keep pop up Data connection required to connect to google play service even if it is connected to Data (im using my Data now to rate this app). I can only use this app when my phone is connected with wifi. Please let me know what to do. Thanks.
It's super but my homework is very though
Ok now this is epic
"It is good app and even helps to keep organize your google docs, slides and others by making titlesvas you want. This works fine on laptop but on my tab it says unfortunately the Google classroom has stopped whenever I open it. Can you please fix it?"
Kindly add option for students to upload pictures of their answers or assignments as it is difficult for them to type whole Mathematics work
Meh...
Good
It's a good app but it dosent allow me to access the attachments posted.
Is good
Do not add #Attachment. Please improve it.
✌😬
The students cannot send the assignment to the teacher only Other than that it is good So please please make the changes
Nice app
"When i read the ppt material in google classroom and returned to using other app and when i returned again to read ppt ,they appear from first page.This is irritating.Please bring update to continue the ppt where i left"
Okay
This is the first time for me to use this aplication but I hope this aplication to help me went me working my exercise
Good experience
good app I learn so much from this app
it isn't letting me sign up
"it's need improvement in terms of idea because professor first sign in paper then they say to upload,Is there any way to digital signature, because everyone can submit single pdf to assignments."
itz comin like claass code not found
i think its a good app but i just dont like the way it is set up
ok
nice
none
good
good i think
"i use Google classroom for school almost every day. almost all the teachers in my school use gclassroom for posting homework assignments and such. for that aspect it works just fine, however it is lacking in certain areas. for instance, Google classroom lacks the functionality for parents to easy check a students Google classroom. I also feel that Google classroom would benefit from even more interactive features, maybe even a more finished test system and grading system."
vrv
good
It's really Useful.It's too easy to use. I think it's be better if we can attach any file with class comments.
it's awesome. i can now do my school work from home with less costs
This Google are amazing I love it so much
it's helpful
pj
Add feature download documents.
A good app but whenever i open it it'll crash
nice
"Almost perfect. 1. It somehow lack in mobile to sort / re-arrange classes. 2. And a quick link to change file permission as downloadable if your a teacher. 3. Google forms launch as a separate app, it is better if it can open inside this app. 4. hope night mode is available"
very useful
"A great initiative as always by Google but need a few more features and some improvements but considering the app was launched less than a fortnight ago, I know you guys will improve it in near future."

suddenly it stopped opening. don't understand why. I will try to install it again.
no problem
good
"Tends to bug out a lot when adding a new account. Often crashes on my Google Pixel 2 when opening the main menu thay displays all classes. It's really unfortunate to give this app a 3 star rating, as I use it daily and is required for my academic uses. Usually, I'm very impressed with Google apps, as the all perform smoothly, but I just cannot say the same about Google Classroom."
love this app because it helps my studies
Rated e for everyone

A 7 grade teacher and I am I love with  this
simply best for education
so i know the hwk
"Classroom is a free service for schools, non-profit organsations and anyone with a personal Google account. Organsations... Noice one google"
"I am very happy this is what my college decided to use since it is very easy to access, learn and separate subjects. However one issue I have is the fact the the day before and the day a assignment is due the time it's due disappears, and it's pretty important because if it's 00:01 or 23:59 means a whole day difference."
Helped
F9
Not that bad I can do school work here and there
I think it is a great way to see your teacher's assignments for your classes and you can also do them at home.
This app is wonderful
Fine app
nice app to communicate with teachers and get to know about student's progress.
"Sometimes, the notification app didn't show. What's the problem?"
It is useful
it is really good gives me updated on school
"Best app, thanks for google to make learning that much easy."
"It's great, but if I'm locked out of my account I can't sign out and use a different account"
There is a feature in Google classroom iOS to swipe between images inside an assignment but Android doesn't have. it is a very handy feature please add.
I like it
Good
Nice app
I absoulutly love this app!😀 it is so easy to comunicate to your teacher!
Very good the app
really good
Ood
It's very useful for getting knowledge
Nice
I like it and all but is there a way to change your profile picture? I've been having troubles and its just so stressful.
Ya ya ya
Best than chak & take methode
I love it
Please let us view the Archived Classes in the app only!!
Thanks for app
It is not the best thing but it is pretty dang good. Better than Edmodo at the very least.
It's good one
Its really helpful for school and homework
gud
It works great wish I could use it on mobile to type up my work
It's good connecting to my classmates
Not bad. Easy to use
Collects and saves tons of classroom information
"Boring it's school obviously it's boring but I got to admit it really is 
helpful i miss the days using paper.. Lazy ass teachers"
It helpful
Good interaction between teacher and student
Its Ok
I luv the App 2years running en my kids luv it. The excitement is ecstatic
I really like this app because it helps with organizing assignments and turning them in. However I do not like the fact that it doesn't notify you when your teachers post something.
Working great so far. A good addition to have is the ability for the teacher to change student names so that it is easier for them to manage the grade-book.
Plz give the facility to ask questions with teachers personally ... Thanks
Useful
we're forced to get it for school so suck my ass
Educational
"This is a nice app to use for classwork, but I wish it didn't get the update."
Helpful
we canot upload pdfs or photos as answer
"Takes up minimal storage on my mobile, and when combined with Google docs has adequate functionality and features. I also like that I am notified every time something is posted on one of my classes so I am always up to date"
It would be awesome if there were a version for parents that can connect to multiple kids accounts
Pretty good school app
Please add the ATTENDANCE option in Google Classroom as soon as possible....Thanks
Great app. Only wish it was a little more homeschool user friendly.
Automatically organized and easy to use
Because of this classroom method adopted in our clg we needs to finish our assignment on time
It's Okay and I can my assignment
Good
It is very  good app
It has really helped me
Its really good.if this keeps up we wouldn't go to school
I've had very few issues with google classroom. The only problem I had was not being able to join a class.
I would love it if it gave notifications for due dates!
👍👍👍
Good
Great for school
takes WAY to long to download
Nice app works better

Liked It
Hoi hoi
Good way to talk with teachers
"Makes it much more accessible for students. For anyone wondering about the About section, I think resources you add to that section are still available through the Classroom Folder at the bottom of the home menu."
It is great for doing my school work at home

Good help for students
It is quite slow while downloading
Google Classroom is a great interactive app for students to communicate with their teachers and do their work.
The app keeps changing my due dates to Saturday. I would love a bug fix for this. Thanks! :)
More useful for students
Not bad
Good and very useful app.....Thank u GOOGLE....🙂
App that helps teaching and taking notes
After last update cannot log into my classrooms
This is a good and helpful app that helps with my schoolwork but I don't think it is very mobile friendly just yet. Recently I've been having problems with the app though with me trying to get into my classrooms but them deleting themselves and showing an error message.
Gud
Working perfectly fine now..
"As there is syncing error in the app, the students are struggling so much, so please fix it"
Good but it says i am not in my classes
plz make auto sync with Google device policy as soon as this app opens.or else it makes it difficult to use
nice
Upadate is very awful as my account is not getting detected
Enable download option pls It's making difficult to visit info when we are offline
Awesome solution for your webinars
Nicee

This is too much Good
Good
"Reading comments, especially as a teacher is not a smooth experience. It should be like Facebook. Also, despite some students having done the work, their status is not showing as 'turned in' and I cannot figure out where is the problem."
"It's good, but I would like to put a feature that teachers could message you back."
"This is a realy good app, it's just, I cant tell weather someone posts a pic or not."
I use at school.😏DuH.
It helps me work better with my coursemates
I love it exspecially when i was playing schools.
Please put function that enable students to setup or use alias name (eg. student number). It is difficult to grade or check student works by their name in email.

"One improvement i really want to recommend is every time I switch between aaps and when I return to classroom it always take me to the first page, which is very irritating for me."
Good for school
"This app is great and all but it needs a dark mode setting , could we please have dark mode integrate into the app please"
Nice
There is room for improvement but overall good app for class/educational use.
For my kids assignment is okay
i need the pop up feature so I can see the new notifications.
"You can't really do your work on here that well. That's why the computer is better for it, but the phone is great to quick access."

"Work well, easy to use"
It's very helpful. It helps the students to study well.
As a high schooler I know how difficult it could be to keep track of all your work so it's nice to have something to help you keep track and to have all of your homework easily on your own technical device
I hacked my friend
This is good practice for high school

Amassing
"There's people that have a love and hate relationship with this app I actually find it extremely useful,because it sets up what assignments i need to do on whatever days what i have already done so I dont have to stress about an assignment that did I or didn't finish it.Not just that but also you can also see other students comments to see if a question you needed answered was answered.I saw something that a student wants to ban or cancel this app and I am so UPSET because this really HELPS me!"

Nice app to connect
Don't take away Hangouts .... Kill Allo
"The android app does not seem to let you join a meeting by using your phone 
the old fashioned way (holding it up to the side of your head). That seems 
like an obvious and desirable mode of use."
Audio and Video mute / unmute issues. Full screen function not as good as hangouts
"Only speaker, we need telephone mode."
"Only allows speaker mode, is absolutely not a functional product. Can't mute it or turn the volume down or just use your phones internal speaker."
"From a business use perspective, this is a terrible idea. My business recently switched to G Suite, and the last thing we need right now is lack of stability in app usage. I'm IT, so this will be my problem."
One of the worst app from Google... Seriously no audio output switching.... It ain't fun to use speaker for meetings.... I don't know how could they even managed to remove this feature.
It doesn't work on Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. It's one of the best stylus tablets available running Android 5.1.1 and for some reason it's not supported.
Awful
Unusable for me until it support Bluetooth headsets
always need upgrade when i wanna use it
should make meet and chat the same app called it hangouts for business
Google! Stop! What are you doing?  We can't tell what your direction is with Messaging on Android.
"Come on Google can't you just make one Unified app for all the communication. Hangout, Allo, Duo, Messenger, Voice now multiple Hangout apps as well."
Not working as expected
Incoherent
"Horrible, hangouts worked better before this split."
"So google has allo,duo,meet, Hangouts,chat,Android messages. Are serious? You confuse people, I understand that you want to keep the Hangouts User base but common, you make simple things complicated. Just include duo in Allo . And make Allo to support SMS so u can delete Android messages, and ofc Hangouts is dead already, it cannot compete against WhatsApp, messenger, Skype,Viber which are the top .. GUESS WHY. They have all in one apps , not one for chat, another for videos, another for chat but for professionals, another for meetings for professionals,another for SMS etc etc"
No way to switch to headset speaker.
"Forces speaker mode and doesn't even work with Bluetooth headphones - 
seriously?"
This program crash A LOT during long meetings.
Integration with duo and make it cobsumer
AVERAGE
Somehow always bounced me back from the meeting I should have joined. The others see duplicate of me in the room but I'm not even in. Poor apps.
What a piece of UX garbage made by a completely clueless team. How about we break each component of messaging into a separate app?
"Not possible to switch from loudspeaker to normal mode. When on the go, you 
dont always want the rest of the world to listen in to your meetings."
Hangouts is full of women who want only one thing that I've chatted with and that is money that's all I have been getting from them
sucks
Too many pieces to this puzzle of an app.. Combine them... Don't be like stupid Facebook work messenger... Leave it one app..
"I hate that it opens a browser to launch, it's super unreliable."
lousy
WebEx and Zoom.us quality is so much better than Hangouts Meet
Let useful than Hangouts. Why did they even bother to make it?
Completely useless.  There are literally no options.  There is literally nothing you can do with the app.  You can't invite anyone or anything.  Completely and utterly useless!
"All the five star reviews are suspect for this app.  Google, thanks for fragmenting your messaging ecosystem again, and making me explain what app to use when/where to my friends and associates. This is a bad user experience since now I have all the Google messaging apps on my phone in case I can't interface with one of my clients."
I will will iu
Worthless app and stupid name. COMBINE ALLO AND DUO!!
app force closed as soon as installed on brand new phone. Why fragment hangouts? This is just stupid. Whatever team thought this was a good idea should slap themselves. Whatever management approved it should be fired and forbidden from working in tech industry ever again.
"Why use this when we can easily create meetings, join meetings, chat, change volume etc in appear.in for free?"
Boooo stop fragmenting hangouts!!!!
This new app sucks. Let's make about 5 more message apps. Idiotic.
"App keep on crashing while in meeting, and not able to add professional id with personal email id"
"The app is using too much cellular mobile data (GBs for meetings lasted less than an hour). Needs to reduce size down to levels of other apps (e.g. skype , facebook messenger etc). Will update review after this is done."
"Really? Why can't y'all keep 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 the original, than adding new abandonware‽"
"awful app, UI is confusing and a total mess, why google is splitting hangouts into two pointless apps is baffling, I'll be using skype and Microsofts services instead once hangouts dies"
"Why more apps instead of one good one that everyone​ uses. Hangouts, duo, alo, hangouts meet ...What's next???"
"No Firefox support, so I'm unable to get it working at all. Hard to use, and a terrible experience overall. Discord works much better for all purposes."
Twice now this app has decided to open on its own while I'm sitting on the toilet.
Everyone complains of audio echos when I use this from my s8.
Not necessary. Just make Hangouts look like Allo.... You don't have to make things difficult. We don't want iMessage and FaceTime.
I'm getting chat nosebleeds. Google is actively destroying it's own user base.
It sucks. I have tried to download this app for two days now. Not getting it downloaded.  Can someone tell me why. I even call your support line n they can't help me
For a business app to not work with a work profile the phone is a major problem.
Why can't earphones be used as an output? It makes using it very annoying
Took way too long to download had a important interview video chat I missed it.  15-20 to download.
Audio is frequently switched from Bluetooth to phone speaker. It is unusable and I quitted the  meeting. My BT works well with all other apps.
Battery draining
"Horrible interface. Lack of controls. Lack of permission to undo your own 
mute. I'll never use this app again. So many better free alternatives."
Facing problem while video chating.
"Let me pick the output audio device, you knobs!"
Not able to download the app
"No way to speak without headphones other than using a speakerphone, that 
was not an issue with hangouts."
good
You cannot join video call while you are on a phone call!
"This would be useful if it had builtin chat. Same problem in having with duo. WhatsApp is still the best. Or three original Hangouts, but no one uses that anymore. It was great being built into Gmail"
"Here's an awesome idea: You should combine Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat into one awesome app and call it ""Hangouts""!!! Wait... I guess that's already been done. Leave Hangouts alone! Stop wasting our time with these worthless apps! (Messenger, Allo, Duo, Hangouts Chat, Hangouts Meet). BTW congratulations on your ""Who's Down"" failing to launch! Go crawl in a corner and cry. Stop trying to destroy a good app... (Hangouts)"
Fragmented apps
"Google looks really lost. Why else would they be destroying their userbase with this fragmented crap. Give us one good solid Hangouts that can do everything, not a dozen different messaging programs that do just one thing. Pay attention!"
It would be better to have single app
Google is really messing this up big time!
doesn't work with blue tooth headsets. I tried attending calls but every time it refuses to connect my plantronics bt headset.
"I hate this app. I do hangouts and live it but this,👎"
Needs support for switching audio output
would not download missed my call
"It crashes 24/7. When you are in a call but using another app, suddenly, it stops to work. It is hard to recognize when you are the one who is talking and others are listening only. I feel like an idiot when it happens 3 times in 15 minutes. It also stops to work when you unlock you phone after it has got locked because of no ""manual activity""."
sound is not working and I use this for work
Can not install this app says download pending ? Why?
"Yet another video conference app to download, trashy. Probably will be 
discontinued in a year knowing Google."
"Please don't force update aspecially, while I'm driving!"
Battery drain!
Fire whoever had this stupid idea. Fire the entire team.
"Combine duo, allo, messenger and hangout"
couldnt get diary to load or add in meeting code to join
Geared towards business?? What business in their right mind would trust Google to not abandon this app as soon as they switch to it? Regular Hangouts was on the way to being a great app for business and personal users alike. Then...
"Why you guys are creating different apps? Totally useless. Finally, u rush on people to leave hangouts completely."
Google talk was better
BEWARE OF A FRAUDULENT COMPANY ADECCO BEWARE OF IDENTITY THEFT
"Why not combine all of your chat apps into one, it would be much more easy and fluid for the customer"
good
"What you don't see is that when you change the UX so drastically and I have 
an important meeting, you just ruined my day! Where the hell is the 
speaker-phone button. Is this not meant to be used on a phone anymore?"
Cancel it please not what i wanted.
I can't get the Hangout and why?
Pointless I'm not sure why Google makes good apps and than either forgets them or makes another app that is the pretty much the same thing or separate. Google should just do what imessage does all in one messaging app for desktop on a pc and for your phone maybe put all your messaging tech on one app like allo or Android messages?
"Due to unwanted noise from app, my interview schedule has been canceled."
Dum
I think if you want to join a meeting just download hangout app. I download this app to connect a meeting. After successfully downloaded this also required hangout app to connect a meeting. In direct way you are doing meeting via hangout. Hangout meet app is just to get the meeting invitation. Most probably i use WhatsApp video call which is more better than hangout. This app required high internet speed even only with two participants. Not found useful app. Voice break. Poor video quality.
"ANOTHER MESSENGER APP? Combine allo, Hangouts, Messenger, and duo. Google. Come on. You had this done 2009 - why did you go backwards?"
Why ruin a good thing? I don't understand why I can't switch the audio from speaker to handset.
It don't want to download
"Google, focus on Hangouts.  It is nice to be able to switch between tasks like voice text and video all in one app"
Uve created a living hell for me
Pls give destop verrion ( PC) app downlprding link
Why there is no indian number in the international dial in numbers list in order to join the meeting from phone?
Ok
Why. Why does it automatically turn on video and mic when joined meeting from notifications please please solve this issue
Horrible

Crashing not proper audio
Not feeling well enough
This app is the worst. I turned off my microphone and camera before joining a meeting and then when i joined the meeting my mic and camera were on. i was so embrassed in front of 60.
I cant use this app. And i cant hear nothing... first day it was useful.. but then it didnt work.. all time when i open this app the message fir rating is coming.. and if i touch any of the option it would stopped. I cant attend my classes while others are attending the class normally. So i reinstalled this app for better use. But it repeats the same. And i rated the app. But it is repeatig. Why.. 😔😔
Worst application. Not possible to download and install. Even there is no network issue.
"Needs improvement , uses large amount of data"
Not good
well i can't use it

The audio and video quality is worst
Buhut mb khata h
It is the worst app in the whole universe.Whenever I try to join a meeting this begging app always keep on begging for a feedback. It does not even work properly and the services which it provides are so bad.This app should be removed from play store.Very bad performance.Not satisfied.👎
Excelleny
Good
Its good
It is a use less app. Whenever I try to write something someone joined and left just pop up be there for a few minutes. They cover the chat box and I am unable to write anything. Even when my phone is horizontal that message takes the whole bottom area and does the same. I have tried many things and the only possible way is to leave the meeting and join again which is not possible every time I lost all my hope and I am deleting this.
No speakerphone option? How am I supposed to talk and see video at the same time when I have to hold the phone up to my ear...
how can i start a meeting room !!!
Subpar to FB messenger. No one knows how to work it.
add screen sharing for mobile app because mostly meeting app has function and if customer paying money should be google has to add function
Why I cannot switch audio to phone dynamic (not speakerphone) without handsfree?
"Doesn't work. Even if it eventually does I'm not sure how they expect you 
to go weeks without insurance while waiting for their app to tally your 
driving score or whatever."
Quo Vadis Google?
wastage of data as there is no option to set the quality of video. We may need audio only with lowest quality. This will help us when network is slow. There is no chat option. desktop version is better.
"Works on an Android 7 phone, but not on my Google Nexus 7 (2013). And guess what, on that I can't rate the app because PlayStore errors out. Smart move to get high ratings."
xnxx.co xnxx.co
"The fact that I can't control the audio output makes this app essentially useless for me. I would love to be able to play audio through my Bluetooth headphones and control the volume. The two times I've tried to use this app, I'm completely unable to hear anything anyone is saying."
"It won't allow me to join or put link or code and also crashing, volume keeps being low, and quality poor, and not good for business"
I'd rather use hangout to make video calls I
"Meet launches the traditional Hangouts app when I join a video call, so why 
should I even use Meet?"
"The new concept of Meet is solid. I like that there are built in phone numbers.  This app is not as good. Why can't I switch between normal phone, speaker, and headset? The top/bottom split also makes it harder to see who is on a call, because I can't see as many at once. Call quality seems the same as hangouts."
Is this a April fool prank but in March? Just when I got used to having a million messaging apps Google makes a few more
app crashed
The app is always crashing when I open it. I tried to reinstall
"The new Meet app doesn't seem to work with headphones on my Pixel XL. The 
old Hangouts app let me switch the output device but there is no such 
feature in the new one. It uses the phone speaker. That makes it largely 
impossible to take calls on the go. Big step back. To add insult to injury, 
there is no obvious way to use the meeting code and connect via the old 
Hangouts app."
Cannot hear people if video is active.
Meetings don't list until the last min.  It doesn't show all day meetings
"What is up with the name Hangout...hate it, hate it hate it. It is unprofessional. You come up with a great name like Meet and it has to be tagged with Hangout? Come on Google...get some adults involved in Marketing.  Get rid of the Hangout name so I can tell customers with a straight face the app to download and you will get at least 3 more stars."
Oh i can't see or hear the other callers voice and video chating
"No speaker phone option. Useless for meetings. Defeats the entire purpose 
of the app."
"What's the point of this app? And what's the use of Google Duo then? It's like ""old wine in the same old bottle"""
It is not bad but is really buggy...call quality needs to improve a lot!!. The huge killer is that is being restricted to chrome
"Hy...these past months, I cant login meet through phone...only able to login via laptop. I tried to install again but still cant. hemm"
Not syncing with google Calendar. Shows two errors..on existing calendar entries- hangouts will be added and on new event- no available conference
I can't get in on my phone
Wow
Buggy and feature incomplete.  Poor replacement for hangouts and definitely needs a dozen work sprints to reach minimum release functionality.
"Fragment Hangouts? Yeah sure, great idea. We have a solid idea, now time to make it more of a pain for everyone to use. Allo, Duo, ah screw that. It was well hyped, and we could have combined them.  But whatever. We don't care about our users."
CPU and data hoarder. Both Web and mobile versions.
Nice aps
"I'm not sure why this is separate from Hangouts, or why there isn't an option to pipe audio through the ear speaker like a phone. Having a meeting in a public place is a pain."
"Good app! But no dial in number for India, for that matter any Asian country! Doesn't deserve more than 2 stars just for that."
No sound on video calls.
Some idiot thought not allowing you TO MUTE and listen on another device wouldn't be useful. Why the hell would you not allow the user TO MUTE their own device???? Who thought that was a GREAT IDEA and what moron approved that stupid idea???? The person who approved that should be flipping burgers with the idiot from the Boeing software team that thought not testing software was smart! Use another meeting so until this gets stuck off of STUPID!
"While there are some other issues... the most glaring issue is that I cant MUTE the audio and I cant use a BLUETOOTH HEADSET.  When I am in a public place or even at my desk at work and using my Android phone to connect to a video chat to see presentations I ***CANNOT*** turn off the audio, reduce it beyond a certain level OR USE BLUETOOTH HEADSET.  I can use a wired headset but come on!"
The app is awesome for meetings but there is no option to control audio. I cannot switch to handset mode from speaker mode. The only option available in settings is send feedback option.
"This app is connected to accounts to date woman in Africa and also 
connected to naughty sex dating websites. Clean up this app."
"Once a meet call is interrupted by a phone call, I cannot join a meet call. This message prompts even if I'm not in a phone call ""you can't join a video call when you are in a phone call""."
"Fragmented and confused even with a G-suite account. Don't understand why necessary, except perhaps the unique video call names in Meet."
"No phone mode on a mobile app? Anytime I can use the speakers I'm on a 
laptop. When I'm using the phone I need a phone mode. Please add this basic 
feature."
"not backwards compatible, doesn't remember my mute options"
not not
i cannot switch to my google work account - i have work profile (separate work container behind android personal account). problems to join in this setup
*Zzzg
Please i need a code
SOOO COMPLICATED
In latest version why I am not able to see shared screen which is shared by my partner . It appears first but as soon as i rotate my screen vertical to horizontal shared screen will get disappeared. please fix it as soon as possible
"You can't switch to other apps while in a video call! It's annoying and makes it impossible to work... it was OK until a few weeks ago, what happened???"
I am not sure why there was the bed of another app when there was hangout. This app is also weird. I did not see the app open but people were able to hear me and see me in the meeting for the whole day.
I shouldn't have to re-enter a room code each time I'm bumped out (if someone isn't there to let me in).
"From Google i expected more. They should just check out the ZOOM and make it better. Why all this apps Duo Hangouts Hangouts Meet ... They should make one more app maybe for video calls 😅 Just take DUO, make it to have 100 people for free with time limit (30min), screen sharing, host change, screen share, working in background. Do you ever do market research?"
Not sure
"Hangouts meet is pointless and redundant (Google has three Hangouts services that are all the same thing?) for G Suite users, but it seems to work without crashing at least."
The + button doesn't show to start a new meeting
Was having a high hope until i found out that screen sharing from android devices is missing yet the option is there for IOS. What a shame since Google owns Android. Would rate more than 5 stars if the option is there since I'm working with android devices with stylus and phone connectivity that enables me to be connected anytime anywhere. Hangouts Meet seemed perfect for me to conduct training but this issue is a major let down. Would glad to get notified when the feature is available.
Good but the audio and video break and pixelate so much i don't reccomend it to anyone!!
Good video but no option for dial in in India
"Happy to update review once fixed, but I hope you see this feedback to help fix a big issue. Note 8 using airpods. If I am on a call using meet and then an incoming cell call comes, my airpod pros lose connection with the meet app even if I decline the call and to fix it I need to turn Bluetooth off and on again. Please fix :)"
"No option to unmirror video, which I need. Seems fine for anyone who doesn't need that."
I can't even download this app.
Put a input bar where you can type in URLs and go to your meeting.
"Needs better permissions for a meeting leader. Ability to block participants from rejoining. Ability to end the meeting. Not allowing others to kick the meeting leader out, or mute them for everyone."
can't we use this app by plugging in our earphones ??
Amezing
"I could not control the loud audio coming out of the app, even muting the speakers. I had to borrow headset from my girlfriend and the only way to cut the volume out of the phone speakers. Please fix."
No recording option
Google should kill this!
"I rate this app good for meeting friends online but because the lecturer uses it to teach online while I don't like this, I would rate it 1 star. But because this app is green and my girlfriend likes green so I rate this app 2 stars."
Sucks
"There is no designated meeting leader, so anyone can kick anyone else bout of the meeting, or mute them...even if they were the ones who called the meeting. Also, there's no way to end the meeting... everyone just has to leave on their own. Google really needs to step up their game."
It was very chaotic when many people joined and it was all over the place
It's a poorly optimized app that slows my phone so bad that even after I completely close it I can't use my phone and have to completely restart my phone.
Nice
An absolute shame you cannot have a tiled view of all participants Instead the loudest talkers keep popping in your face.
"I can't even start a meet because There is only a ""Enter code"" Button! So it is pointless if I can't use it!"
There are too many people talking at the same time that you don't even know what's going on . But at least this app is save.
"Like the rest of Google's offering, it ""works,"" but not very well. It needs to be polished, meeting codes are not remembered, frustrating when you get dropped out and need to rejoin, video drops out and freezes intermittently, why are these basic features not implemented and bugs fixed before it's released?"
"Found it wonky to use, Seemed confusing to some in the mechanics of it"
I like ir
I dont hv + sign on my hangout. Samsung note 5
Nobody could hear me
"Sound problems, in phone mode I don't hear nothing and in speaker mode it's way too loud... (For someone who suffers from tinnitus, a one-hour long lesson is a pain) Plus, when we write, there's nothing to tell our interlocutor(s) than we're typing."
Frequent disconnections
I can't do anything except for joining meeting no use u can use other apps instead
I want to be able to have automatic access to create my own meetings.
When we are on video call in hangouts meet if normal phone call came suddenly (reject the phone call ) the video call voice is not audible after rejected the normal phone call
"They offer good video call quality only when you have excellent network strength. But when you don't you get removed automatically. It's more in the app's updated version, earlier it wasn't so. Earlier poor network would only reduce the quality of video call, these days either you have a good video conference or you don't at all. It's very irritating how the app is made to remove you automatically and it does the same when the app runs in background. How inconvenient!!"
Very bad indeed
Its buggy it very glitchy and In my opionin its not very clear to use
None yet.
"Poor chromebook support, you are only able to have one member of the call large at a time instead of all the same size as seen in skype. Should have the ability to change that. Otherwise it works pretty well."
Horrible when I tried getting inside the meeting it would say no SUCH MEETING And I missed half of my meetings because IT WOULDN'T WORK it worked sometimes that's why I gave it 2 stars but in all horrible my other co workers got in no problem but IT WOULDN'T LET ME IN fix this problem and I might consider putting it on 4 stars
Srry
Not available
Not working well
"Very unreliable. Tried to enter a code, did not work. I could not unmute myself, nor could I turn the camera off. Suggestion: use chrome instead. Works better on google or chrome than on the app."
Missing view of all participants is pretty annoying. Constantly switches between views. Web version is much better.
internet consumption very high add feature screen share
How much person can attend on a onLine classses.
Good
When I am in my meeting unfortunately it asks me rate us. so I was clicking on option not now so in second it comes on home page so I have to again join to the meeting and If I rate them then also it comes on home page I am so disappointed.. So I had given it 1 star PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.........PLEASE...........
"It's funny to see the admin, refers the critic and suggestion to go to the app -> help and feedback. You definitely can read it here as well."
Yyy
I was not able to hear anything in my urgent meeting. I hate it. It tells to rate the app in between the meeting and it's very annoying.
Unfortanely my google meet is stopped.....bad experience
I am facing issuse while using this app..the slides shared by teachers aren't visible and the voice keep getting fragmented
"If I accidentally pressed the back button, it immediately gets out of the meeting. I think it would be great if it asks for confirmation before leaving the meeting."
my all mobile data is over because of this app
"not up to par with zoom... a bit disappointed.. unless i missed it, is there no breakout room option? it would be nice if that was easily accessible. also, it's not letting me share documents or my screen... :( it would also be nice to easily toggle between speaker view and gallery view... not easily accesible... and when everyone's mic is on, it creates a very distorted sound..."
They should give the private chatting options.
I love this app
It is a good aap to attend meetings
Please give it offline
"Hi, this is my first time using google meeting. But I failed to join the meeting either by link or meeting code. And it keep say that ""failed to join meeting"" or ""no such meeting"". May I know what the problem?"
Very bad experience some times
Very bad and it hanked my phone. But it is so nice
Good app for online class but its vedio and microphone are not working properly
Phone getting heat up while using this app..please give solution
Internet consumption 600 Mb when mobile to mobile meeting done for 10 min. There is not option for mobile user to change the quality of meeting... Please add this option...
Good
Disturp to ur rating and touch meeting call cut it this is very very disturped ???
I hate this app.this is allways asking for feed back. when i gave feedback. Iam coming out of meeting.i dont know how it is happening. Please change this. Dont ask feed back again and again.i am too irritated by this.with this irritation i un installed this 10times and again i installed this for to see on line classes by my teachers. Please change this asking feed back.again and again.......
It's good but sometimes it takes a long time to load.
alwas asking to rate we can't to talk properly
It has a mini screen and is not good for teaching but good for chating
Worst experience among all video conferencing options available.
ज खजुराहो
"We decided to conduct training through Meet as u noted in this App, it supports 250 members. But we cant add more than 100 members"
Rating in between conference get lost class so o give this star pls improve ur mistakes
The voice echoing double so please try to fix it
If I share my screen it only works half for the participants. There is no option for maximising the screen to full screen
Audio was not clear
The video and audio quality is ok...but the main drawback is that with just one click on back button we will leave the meeting...it's really frustrating
"1. When someone is presenting their portrait screen, I can't see the contents clearly because you only give me upper half of the screen to see, don't you think it's too small for a size like handphone? Make a fullscreen view option please. 2. Make an option to choose between standard layout or grid layout in video conferencing. 3. What's up with the back button? If I accidentally press the back button I'm out of the meeting? What were you thinking? I've sent feedback from the app but no respond."
Please add grid view
"Always disconnet automatically,very bad experience."
Hi data conguem?
Hi I have done space cleaning and restarted the phone but still showing Google meet has been stopped and starts buffering. Help me to get sought out this.
The sound quality on the app is very bad. Talking on a 2way radio sounds way better than this
"Some when we are in meating voice is breaking,when it is corrected it is goof 😀"
Not so good
It is ok because this app always ask the rating so i can't attend the meeting
"I am useing Micromax c1. In google meet, camera shows very dark, where as it is brighter when normal vedio mode"
Worst app till date. I never had issues with any app until now. Why I'm not able to connect with my video. I've given every permission even extra permission. I've done everything from clearing cache n data to uninstalling n reinstalling it. Nothing works help me if u can
Good but need improvement
The size must be larger and then it is ok
The app is very data consuming and charge consuming but it is ok
Spanish-American experience
Good
I'm automatically exiting when I enter in a meet
"Tbh, zoom is better."
This app is a trash.I can't do my class properly.And also the person who is talking has an echo and the screen is blury.This is not my connection's problem.
"So good, but sometimes this app ask to gift review while I'm in meetings lol so many times I should sign in and sign out to give the review"
Good but less options
"Bad, switching to Microsoft teams."
The back gesture makes the app to completely close and exit the meeting. Also the meeting codes are like cjsu-jisn-ojhw etc and would be nice if they were digits. Really a bad app considering it is from Google Co. Also there aren't any grid view.
It doesn't have a good flow while meeting. The app could have added more features. The video is stuck and not clear .
"Google already had Duo app why can't they improve it. Meet needs further improvement, provide option for host to control the participants their video and audio. Major problem in this app any body can present without host permission it causes serious problem and chaos. This app take more data and battery. Provide option for background continuation of running app even during voice call and finally design needs lot of improvement!! Hope team look into it and try to satisfy consumers.🙏 Thank you"
Always disturbing with review
It is not working for me now a days. Every time it shows an error message like ' failed to join the meeting'
Very bad app
The audio is breaking
It is a nice aap. We can talk together from this aap.
Sorry but it consuming more data then microsoft team so microsoft is better then google meet
It's quality can be better
This app is amazing And also not take much data but it's video quality is very bad
2 star because while iam ina meet it is always asking rating about audio when we rate google meet will end.booo!!👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😠😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😠🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Facing problem in hearing voice.. i cant hear the voice of other person but they all can hear mee..
It's sound is breaking
Not really a good app
"Half baked app from Google - doesn't save meetings, can't schedule from within the app, no notification when participants have joined when you are the organiser (if not already joined), can't automatically set audience to be muted."
The voice was not coming clearly and again and again the video wqs ending
I think it is the best app for meeting from the help of Google
I love
It's is use to study
helpful app but for students not at all good app
Please give us the option of controlling video quality like 360 or 720 p because some time it uses the whole mobile data around 1 to 1.5 gb in one hour only in mobile application.
Voice quality is pathetic
Not a good app for meeting. On cloudy weather video will become blurred and you cannot see the video clearly. No customization in the app. You cannot add profile photo. You cannot change name also. Please update this app tomsolve above problems.
Average app
Meet has no sound when casted to a TV. Can you please fix this
Not so good
It uses a lot of data when video is on (about 600mb/h)
Xbxxxxxxxxxxxv
This have problem but I have no chocie but to use it
I so many try to download google meet app but helpless my phone is vivo 1610 please help.. thx
"Video quality is poor, sound quality was poor, used zoom with no issues on the same network."
Why i cant open it on my phone? And why i cant connect my mic when in laptop?
"I am sure my internet has a strong speed. Now what can i do with issue meet has stopped . i have tried all things you said. My phone version is 5,1"
It doesn't have a good flow(frame rate) while conferenecing. It clearly has less features than Zoom. But as a google fan I expected a lot more from u. It really didnt meet my expectation and the UX is also awful. The app could have added more features. You are google and you guys could do a lot better job at this. Come on guys tbh this looks like you made it cuz ur boss wanted to get it finished ASAP. Not as good as other Google products
"Great experience, but it's better to add some additional features like. 1:add an additional mute button to mute others except the presenting person.because sometimes others annoying the presentation 2:add an extra option to save the presentation as a Video , so we could refer that later. 3:add a full screen option ,when it comes to Mobile phone it's very difficult to read the content from the presentation 4:also make it usable for casual video conference.. 5: reinforce app's UI"
Good
It's very bad app when i attend my online class it show to rate even though i rated the promblem is not solved ...... When i click on not now it will cut
"While I am watching my video lecture my Google meet get unfortunately stopped, I am facing many problems"
"Experience are bad ,any time saw send report"
I can't see anyone & hear anything
"Not working on Google Chrome, can't find my webcam even though my camera is set up to allow apps to use the camera, my camera is working fine through Skype and standalone. It's not allowing me to add or change the device even though one is present. I'd love it to work on my laptop even tried to install the app since my Samsung laptop also works as a tablet... but it's not installing properly. I wish I didn't have to do this meeting on my Samsung Note 10 tablet but it is what it is now..."
"So, yet another video chat app. Yea yea, for businesses, not sure what that means but it's the same as all the other video apps. Make ONE app. ONE app like Hangouts WAS, until you ruined it."
"Mute appears to get stuck. If used once, when unmuting, it appears to swith off, but nobody hears me."
It helps to reaching people easily
Needs tablet support and a permanent link for personal meetings.
"Very easy to use. Would love to be able take call of speakerphone. Also, I find on my Galaxy S7 I have to constantly mute my mic to stop some horrible feedback squeals!"
nice
No audio in case I use my Plantronics Discovery 975 bluetooth headset
Lost audio & locked phone  3X during a call. Can't go full-screen to see presentation; needs to prevent device from locking while in a meeting.
"C'est comme les vidéoconférences de Hangouts, c'est juste une nouvelle appli.  Un gros plus pour ceux qui font des conférences avec des clients ou fournisseurs: Le fait de pouvoir rejoindre une conférence sans compte Google, ou bien même par téléphone.  Mais moi, ce dont j'ai surtout besoin, c'est de partager mon écran. J'attends cette fonctionnalité avec impatience."
Need phone integration option.
Complicated I have to spend to much time to get it right
Getting better slowly but surely
I love it and i like you
"The screen sharing function is a must-have. Also, can't change audio modes (speaker to handset for example). Another huge caveat is that on a computer Meet is only available in Chrome which is just simply a no-no."
"It would be nice if the deaf host could control who's screen should be 
""active"", to enlarge the screen for the person who signs."
Pretty good. But do we need yet another Google Messaging platform? It is supposed to be like 'Sl@ck' but missing integrations.
"The standout features of this are it's ui simplicity and great call connection. However ... the decision to breakout the Chat function to a separate, stand-alone app was a stupid, user hostile one."
"User interface is nice. Uses too much internet data for meetings. Cisco 
WebEx is using very less internet data. So this app must use less data then 
WebEx."
"Simple and clear, but missing chat. I need a way to share a link or a document during the meeting."
"Create a G Suite App for Android and create calls in all the Google Apps (like Docs, etc) so that when a G Suite user has the G Suite App on their device, it can utilize the other Google Apps that are a available to non-G Suits users in a different way. I predict you will have an App for G Suite soon. You'd have to. Pump the breaks on this stuff (not for feedback, but for everything else)."
Estaría genial poder encender el flash frontal.
Issues: - can't save bandwidth by turning off video of other participants (unlike in web version) - can't mute using bluetooth action button
I don't know how to use this app...
Trying to use
No ability to mute my own mic.
Good app for con call
No way to change the speaker which means i can't use this app in public. Big oversight
I am a beautiful and I be in the uk
Doesn't bring anything new to the table
echo and poor sound
"Breaks a lot, but overall not bad"
"It was great up until a recent update that broke outgoing video from 
Android devices. Folks using iOS or the web version of Meet are no longer 
able to see Android participants video. Other Android participants are 
Blessed to see each other. Fix this, and add audio output switching and 
we'll be good."
Inability to choose audio device is REALLY frustrating.
I can't call anyone no connection or audio
"After disconnecting a phone call, still I get the message. You are in a Phone call. You cannot join meeting when you are in a phone call."
Poor quality of service in Iran
havent trid it yet
It's good but there are some flaws. You cant out the sound on the handset instead of speaker. You can't join with just sound. You cant mute incoming sound so you can only see image.
Please include a feature to adjust video send & receive quality options just like the desktop version. The app uses too much internet data and I need a way to adjust resolution from my phone.
Wish I could select audio source. Need to be able to use handset or Bluetooth. I am unable to use the app for that reason alone. The rest of the functionality is good no problems.
"I don't get why Google is pushing that app to replace Hangouts when 
obviously is not ready! It doesn't s constantly crashing and have so much 
flow issues!"
Mic don't work if I attach my wired earbuds!
"Unable to switch between Bluetooth, speaker phone and handset ear speaker 
modes. This was easy in Hangouts. But lack of this control is very 
frustrating. If I am on a meeting with Bluetooth in my car and an incoming 
call comes in, it drops to hanset ear speaker with no way to toggle back. 
Seems like a basic faeture, why hasn't it been fixed yet?"
Groups from hangout doesn't migrate here
New
no dark mode or night theme
"The app does not allow voice over bluetooth headsets. Atleast doesnt appear in the listing of sound outputs. Also, please allow the participant box to be smaller than a large tile which cover a part of the presentation in full screen."
"Allow multiwindow mode: android:resizeableActivity=[""true"" ]"
good
7m4k
"Aug 2019 - Still eats my full battery & overheats my phone in less than 30 min chat. Otherwise works well, but the battery and overheating makes me go back to laptop."
"The app itself is great but the hardware support for this is awful. I've tried multiple USB webcams (including the most popular Logitech ones) and all of them have the mic stop working after a few minutes. The issue is isolated to this app as the webcam mics work fine on all other chat apps, including Skype"
people lie
"I've a BT Headphones with a mic. The audio quality is terrible when using telephone profile. If I disable phone profile in BT settings (keep only stereo audio), Meet starts playing audio out of speaker, there is no option to use my smartphone microphone and Hi-Fi BT audio. BTW, Zoom allows such configuration even without BT settings switch"
when will the public get this after Hangouts is shut down?
it was anew and fun exsperince
i have been using this app a while. now when i join the meeting. i was kicked out of the meeting. i was not able to hear the meeting also. i have reinstalled the app. yet it does not solve the problem
i am trying
Still waiting for this to be streamlined with Hangouts Chat
unable to create meeting
Ok
Cool not too bad
A better ux would make a big difference. It works very well though

"Hi, i dont understand why does this app installed on my phone have no access to create new meetings, nor does when i open it on my laptop."
Cool
Good
Fucnctional
Surprised that a Google product has a feature rolled out first on iOS before android. Screen presenting on Hangouts Meet
Zzz
Good enough. But it could be better.
Good
Generally good. Voice and video are stable BUT I can't share my screen in a active call using my Android tablet ! Need to use a desktop PC or iOS....this is a major missing feature !
Should allow to share our screen as well so as to present form out phone in the meetings.
Well if you don't know someone there will alot of lady's asking for money . Scammers
So bad in landscape mode
Android devices can't share screen as far as I can see
Great Thank you
Video was good. However audio not so good. The problem is that there are no options to choose audio routing in the app. I'm using an Android One phone (Nokia 7.2) and I guess the assumption is that Android would correctly choose the routing when I plugged in headphones. However this did not happen on my device. So I ended up with audio coming from headphones and speaker. No volume controls worked and I've no idea whether the headphone or device mic was used. Maybe it's my particular device...
Nice app Thank you
Not tried yet.
"Ogni volta finita una chiamata ti chiede la recensione, poi nel link di condivisione viene tutto attaccato"
It keeps asking me to rate this app and then the app stops.
Atleast put an option of restriction for kicking a fellow in meeting. And a popup should be there for the person who has kicked someone.
Please correct error when you share link to chat from app to WhatsApp formatting on the text there's not enough spacing between the meet URL and the word phone.
Good
can't share my screen during a call
"This app is good. I rated 3 stars because if you are teaching a class, you dont have control over the people who will join. Everyone can mute and kick anyone in the meeting."
There is a proem with its work g the audio breaks and echos and video stops or app misbehaves......... Creators plz check
"Hey Google, how cool would it be if Meet were unlocked for individuals during this time of decreased in-person interaction? My writing group of 10 meets every 3rd Saturday, & tomorrow will be our first remote meeting. I had planned to use Hangouts, but I just learned you can only see 1 person at a time vs. everyone at once. But that w/Meet you can see everyone! I'm an individual though, not a business so I don't have that access. We'll find a different solution for tomorrow, but cheers! I ❤ G"
Can't present from Android (OnePlus 6).......
So for it's difficult.
Good
Good
"How to start or create a meeting, i am not able to find that option in the app??"
"There is no option for recording video, please add recording options on mobile app"
It was ok i was getting bugs when i turn on my battery saver it automatically off by it self.
Should remember last preferences regarding mic and camera.
Please add dial in option for India
"Hi anyone, how to use google meet"
Ok
Good enough for classes
Can't see a way to tile videos
Bad audio and video
"Good audio and video, however video from participants drop and there's no way to get it back"
"После помещения на карантин многие занятия в вузе стали проходить с помощью этого сервиса. Главный существенный недостаток - с телефона невозможно увидеть полную картинку с трансляции, видно только квадратное обрезанное изображение"
Very good app but the only thing that is holding it back for me is the fact that I can't speak because the app doesn't send my voice through
"Overall the platform is decent and does the job well if you are using the right equipment. i.e decent headphones with mic and a computer with a decent camera. Where I think there could be improvements is with ""hand raising"" to highlight you wish to speak in large meetings and a gallery tiled viewed so that you can see everyone on a call. Meetings with over 5 people aren't handled well in terms of end user experience. This is one place where Zoom is a better platform. Would love to see Google introduce this viewing option."
I love Google Hangouts but really a let down that you can't share the screen in the app.
Very hard to mute or do any of the other options while on mobile and app kept closing while i was in the middle of a meeting.
Average
Download
Owesome
I can hear the other person but she can't hear me
Can't use this app sound with bluetooth speakers
Loading
Good. But i dont active my mike..
Good
Nice app. But it lacks option to allow and disallow others from using a microphone or projecting and this becomes a headache during a class.
Call dropped many times
OK good
India call number not yet listed in your list
Gud but voice note is not clear and its should jave option to lool everyone face all together
Ok
Need to be able to see all participants at once (like with Zoom)
Please add a recording option as only the screen records nd not the voice
"Sometime sound is not audible, not show presentation properly and vedio became blurry"
"A good app to do online meetings, especially at coronatime. But, the audio quality isn't really good."
I like this app
È un app molto utile ma pero a volte non mi fa entrare nelle videolezioni soprattutto adesso che mi serve visto che c'è il coronavirus
This app is good but can't start meeting by using my personal email. I can only start meeting by using the email given by my school and i can't use it for my personal meetings. Please check and tell that what is the issue with not allowing personal emails to start the call?
I mean it ok. Never awful but not great. Sometimes it clear and sometimes it not. Its more of 6/10. Could have lots of improvement. The one feature I love this the caption and it pretty clear. Overall it does the job.
Average
Sometimes on PC you're hearing will just cut out and it doesnt come back
how do i install this app in my laptop
Not bad.
"Dear developers, please fix this bug. Its not allowed to join meeting even when the code u type is correct"
bekar
Can't set video layout.. Like in grid view
Video quality not good..
I think its a good app but when it ask for myvphone number my country is no there
It is nice and good app to use
"It should definitely work better on Android, and filters would be nice."
Wow
Plz make this app work on a split screen. Then I can do my online classes and read other stuff while still looking to see how I look to others.
After sometime when i opened the app it was not working and was again and stopping from working but all over the app is very good
It is so long to download
It's good
This app is helpful app but I cannot record my classes because there is no recording option please re-enter the recording option in this app.
"The apps still does NOT support the Meet Nickname URL format ""g.co/meet/""! Why not? The blog announcement was March 19 for associated features in Meet for Schools! We can't wait and Students are frustrated because these Meet links with this URL in Classroom will not open in the Meet app!"
I liked it but i wanted to see everyone on the screen. Not to mention it was a bit laggy.
Terrible. The session cut off shortly after starting.
The problem is don't know how to use. But I need human in human communication. This device I don't trust. What's going on with my Huawei y9. In talking mode and location set at where. I did not accept any compliment or upgrade software but seem like no choice left right need to accept and agreed in all. Press volume up down power to escape
It often lags you int he app and doesn't let you join into the call sometimes
G suite needed
Not this much good but fine
There's no option for Horizontal flip and one cannot turn off the chat box. In vertical orientation if one is presenting it will be not that clear. Audio and Video clarity is good.
"App crashed whenever open, i dont know why it is happen"
Worked for the most part but I usually get kicked off at least once or twice an hour and have plenty of high speed data so it's likely within the app. At times the audio is crackling and others just cuts in and out.
It is confuzed app no proper working gtalk is much better than this app
Give us the option to choose quality type
Yeah
good
Not that good app but better than zoom
two persons can't share screens at a time
Not good
"This app causes several problems such as net problems, audio is not good, video presentation is not good but you can say it is ok.... but also there is one question why it takes a long time to join the link. My teachers are also taking online classes but I can't hear the name of the chapter...... 😈😈😈😈😴😴😴😴"
Bs
The meet is good but the join is late connecting.
"This is good app to have however it do not have facility to mute/unmute using earphone's Mike. So it becomes necessary to hold a phone in hand even if you are using earphone. It also do not have controls on locked screen. So to mute / unmute self, it becomes necessary unlock the Phone."
Trying to get it down loaded
Nice
Aplikasi yang basic menurut saya
I am not getting the option of new meeting.what to do with that? Help me please...
6th class
Voice is cutting and echo issue are there . Also videos are coming blur. All the voices are being repeated twice . All the voices are messing up. Please fix this issues.
Good app
Nice
After the new update.......it's petty....
Good
The app is good
I would give a five star rating only if also starts it's feature to host a meeting for normal accounts as well and not just G-Suite... Please Google we all love you Please be a bit genuine
"It is a good app for video call for 2 people , but this app is not good for more than 3 people,the voice breaks and some people can't listen me and I can't listen of some people. I had higher expectations from this app.😔😔😔"
Sorry I couldn't not hear my teacher or my class mates
Boring and good too!!
online class made me use this app. so 3⭐
Good
Mic didnt work other than that it was good
It's a Decent App. The App Was A Bit Laggy And Some People's Audio Was Loud. It's not that bad of an app. But I Prefer Zoom.
"A good app, but I couldn't enter my meeting code for some reason."
"I cant even add account to this app. Kept having the same issue and cant join the meeting. Wasted alot of my time creating accounts umpteen times and after a few hrs,i gave up. Pls fix the bug to make more user friendly ..."
If you remove someone from the meeting name of the person who removed someone is not shown on the screen. It only shows who was removed but doesn't show who removed the participant. Also another issue is if i get disconnected from the call midway and i rejoin chat history gets deleted. Chat box should show all the messages till the meeting is going on.
Ok
Good app
Good
I miss school.
Okk but needs improvement
A meeting options should be there in Google classroom with proper features that helps both teachers and students to interact.
Not bad
Need more features
Not bad
"Allow participate to join by them own, have to ask admin to allow or wait for the permission, Once link shared it means that you are invited"
Seems nice but i would like some help signing in. I restarted my phone 4 times but it still says unable to join meeting
Okk app Better than zoom app
"When people are joining or leaving or recording, you can't hit send because of the pop up message, it can be annoying if it's a large group. Also, you can't change the view of how people are showing, so only the one who is speaking shows. It doesn't show every person's video if they have it on. It could be cool if you could use Chromecast like in zoom or Cisco Webex, afterall, this is a Google app, so why not?"
Azdxz
I didn't feel it as user friendly. The voice is cracking when the class is going on.And also sometimes I can't able to contact with teacher.
Good but sab time video and voice are not clear
Not bad 😎
"Its very good, but sometimes idk what happens the meeting gets ended and the voice starts cracking"
Eu nao to consiguindo abaixar
Can't schedule my classes 😔
I also suggest To add some feature which help admin to mute others and and add more than 1 screen on big screen who speak at a time
There is no button to leave meeting
Little problem but good
Good
Good app. But need to have split-screen feature enabled for bigger screens
Please give option to write our name as we need wright know it is showing my gmail id
In the middle of class it ask for rating OMG
It's a good app . But how can I change my name when the video conference is going on ?
Good meeting google ap
Good
Very poor
"Best app for Students.. attending a online clisses.. but I have a issue ??? When I'm screen recorder on that time when our class is live , this time I'm not able to record class voice through this app..p Plzz resolve it fastly ??"
Nice
disconnected at times
Bestt
"Audio and vedio is good, but there should be the facility of personal chat."
Good
When someone joins the meet the message typing area get blocked by the notifications and can't sent messages quickly. Also the message can't edit. Can't reply to any messages.
I don't like online classes
Good
Super app
This aap asks for feedback every 5 to 10 minutes
"It is ok but needs more improvement,some it takes more time to get connected."
Sometimes nobody hears what we say
My mic is not working and it is saying the problem is because of the size of call. Please give me a solution..
Very funny
Poor in connection
Good app but not user friendly
Very good
Good morning
Good
"While using Google meet, it doesn't support split screeen and pop up view option. It's one of the major issues behind it . It Can upgrade with these feature soon."
thats good
Very easy to use but has bug when trying to join meeting
Very good app it is very easy to use and very useful
I don't know weather it is network prblm or app issue but audio and the video were breaking up & video was burl sometimes
Very clear voice and video quality is also very good. Present screen is a very good feature. Bur consumes too much data..
Although it is a great app for taking online classes but although if I have good network its pictures are getting mosaic and the sound quality is low and the audio gets stop frequently
"If Screen recording option is there, then it would be better"
Nice app
Its good app but the sometimes my camera doesn't work Pls reply
Don't disturb middle in the call asking ratings
I would've given it 5 stars but for the continious problems of the connection of the video. I could sparely see the others video but for a white screen that appears a few moments after joining the meeting. I have to repeatedly remove myself from the meeting and again join the meeting. Sometimes on reapeted joinings also the video remains a whit screen . Please fix this issue as soon as possible.
It's good
Super
Ok
Super
App bem simples e não usa a banda larga do usuário de uma forma inteligente.
Need to fix timer and reduce data usage
The app is great just a bit of problems but out of 10 I would give it 7.5 👍
Better but not the best
Won't work occasionally.
Low quality
Good
You have to pay money for record video conference
It's nice
Nice!!
Not bad
No white board
It was a good app butithave some problems
What we do for recording
Kya isme photo or pdf share nhi kr sekte h kya..
There is weak picture quality and alot of problem like it shows ratings and suddenly u will be out of the meeting I am not in support to download it
"M facing audio problem, others could not understand what m saying.they couldn't hear my voice. For online classes we need google meet app. Actually we have to take online classes so children not able to hear my voice"
Give more features
Good
Not bad
I am not able to record my meeting
Good App
The app is good for the online classes for student's.
ok
Not more than 100 can join the class
Vsbsbbab
Nice
Ordinary
Nice
This app is very useful for school but it tell that that the google meet isn't reporting every single TIME!!! It's really ...... I hate it
Very good and bad 👎
"Google please help me as my mic doesn't work (only)on your app. No matter how many times I have reinstalled the app and changed my earphone 🎧, my mic just won't work. Regarding to my phone's mic, its all right as it works when in a call. Please see to it and help me🙏🙏 After Google response: Tried what you said a 100 times but my mic still doesn't work."
It is nor good nor bad
Consume more battery
This app is very good
Better if i had in pc's
Pls fix a time for meetings and allow to send private messages
Ok
It would be better if you add reply option👍 in chat
Good
Average
Good
Suddenly showing connection failed
It is super
This app is very useful but during meeting why rate us option appears due to which meeting gets disconnected which is irritating
Not able to download it whats the problem?
Good
"It's pretty good but I don't like it when I have poor internet connection, it makes me leave the app, and when I come back all the texts in the chat are gone. It's really difficult because I use it for school and Everytime it happens I lose information that the lecturers share."
Athra poraaaaaaa
It disturbs me when I'm in video call to rate it
This is ok but good than the other apps like zoom and so on😊😊
It's good
Good
Improve on functionality and aesthetics
"Plz add some more features 1. Share screen like ""zoom"" where we can draw on files or pics 2. We can schedule the meetings directly from the app not from ""calendar"" 3.when we ""share"" the meeting it show the all information about the meeting not only ""meeting id or link"" (this is so irritating) 4. Host have right to mute or unmute all participants"
Super app
Good when it works. Initializing the invite is confusing when interfacing between Android and ios.
Its good but I don't know how to attach photo or files with my smart phone
Please enable the 'Split Screen' mode
Good
Bad and good
Echo sound is there ...and message for give rating appears again n again it results in disconnecting the meeting ..otherwise the app is good
When the net is slow we are automatically kicked out of the meeting. Please try to remove the problem.
It is a good app
Add some facilities. Screen is very small. Make the presentation larger.
szfv
It was an wonderful app
If u present the screen some time front person will not hear ur voice and if again return to the app its start working and also there is voice echoing
"It's good, but every time someone goes in or out of the meeting, the chat is blocked by that messege for like 15 seconds. Which gets really annoying sometimes!"
improve
Nice
Boring app.
Very good app
Yoapik
Better
I am lucky mam i can download this app without deleting anything
A good app but kept stopping Everytime
"The interface is clunky and the app has a lot of bugs, for example it sometimes kicks you out of the meeting for no reason."
Good
Its good but its not clear sound if you are installing it i say pretty good
Audio problem
Difficult to operate
I have white screen while video pinning and not seen presentation of admin.pleas fix in next update
Very beautiful app
video quality is not good but the provision of muting the audio and switching off one 's video is nice.
this is a good app
You should add India for the use phone for audio. In the class I want to say something that I could not write in the chat
It's a very useful app for online conference but please do include grid view in android phones...
Language change option on main page not available
Very good works on low bandwidth Some features missing Can improve much better which is expected from Google
"Some times it doesn't work properly.......... I'm very tired.when l join a meeting lm automatically left from it, I feel very angry"
Nice but connection is weak and whoever is talking their voice cuts....
There is no option of deletion of messages and many times it causes problem Please do something
When I was talking to someone it automatically disconnects pls fix this problem
"This app is fantastic but there will come eco, the presenting will be blurred But, this app is fantastic . I loved this app."
Nice
Nice app but must have personal chat feature for nice inter communication
Good
Suppar
Good
It is a good aap the sound system is also very good the video is virtual but 1 error is there that whenever I start a meet the notification comes that pls rate the aap if I rate it the video is disconnected n if I didn't rate the meet is disconnected again and again
Quality of video & audio must be improved. The names or icon of participants may be kept horizontally to get the more screen space when seen in mobile.
"I can't view full screen display.please made a new option i.e, view full screen and it drains all my hole mobile data"
"I got kicked out most of the time, and the video was glitchy and I could not always hear others. I used this app for face timing teachers, and I almost always got kicked out."
"Since it's used by teachers, this app has passed to the wrong side of the students's law. Not gud not gud guugol :("
How about a mute ALL button. And also higher quality video and audio streams. Especially for music lessons and recitals.
No comment
Please add recording option and a feature to stream live on YouTube and Facebook. Otherwise it's a great app. A 3 star for that reason only. Thanks..
Its an all on good app just when the person is speaking it glitches tons and the quality of the screen viewing its not the best but still fun
Extension are not working properly
I hate this app because of my teachers. They obliges to wake up at 8 a.m. and we have to study a chapter. I am giving tree stars for the option of off audio and camera because it helps you to relax and don't listen to ypur teacher.
Nice
Audio and video quality is poor
Audio Is not clear voice is vibrating and not clear
In this app some time s faced problem
It would be better if you give an update which allows us to schedule meeting
It is really good platform to have meet but there are many more things which Google team can add as a feature. 1. Host can able to check log audit of meet 2. Most of the people unknowingly remove people from meet and the person who got removed can just see 'someone has removed you' so this could be changed with giving name of person who has removed the person.
It's OK I guess
"If we have not downloaded this app we can't join meeting pls change this setting, Thanks 😄"
"Just used it once, and I had trouble figuring out how to change cameras settings. Like Zoom's performance better. I am going to try Duo as well."
No clear voices.
"Everything is fine debarring a few areas. The meeting consisted of a pretty number of sudden disconnections. Moreover, the sound of the speaker seldom becomes inaudible & echoes. But the video quality is not at all appreciative. Once our craft teacher had conducted a video class. But unfortunately the video quality was so hazy & unclear that we students just didn't get anything which she tried to teach us. Moreover her words & sounds were also not clear. Looking forward for certain changes."
Fair
Please try improving the picture aspect ratio it always gets stretched and is never in a normal aspect ratio.
Nice simple
Good but clarity of picture is not nice
It is a very good app and has made it easy for me to study
"Not really nice sound problem arises sometimes , video problem , start presenting problem ."
Please upgrade this app by enabling split screen for tablets. We need to look from our notes while having meetings.
There is no option of Private massages work on it
Itbis good but it use high internet
It uses too much of mobile battery it may also be fault of my device
"More laggy than zoom or Skype, causing people to interrupt each other. Drops long calls without warning or notice. Mute button should be always on screen to quickly mute things like keyboard sounds when not speaking. Impossible to mute incoming audio completely and just have video (I like to have audio through a secondary session on my laptop)"
This app always removes me from the meeting I don't like it so much.
"Its gud but u need to develope more,bring private chat options,and provide full scale of the person who shares the screen,get some additional options and settings in android other than that its gud and nice"
sometimes irritate the app
Not so much good app as there is no place for private chat which is present in zoom
Nice app Please add a feature to chat with a person privately during meetings
very bad
"Streaming is good, but i have 2 complaints 1) the back button should not end meetings. It is frustrating. 2) should have an option for full screen. Please solve these issues and it'll be a 5 star."
Lots of hottie and weirdos
Net slow
Happy
Assent
"Great app, light weight. Can you add screen sharing while in meeting? would really help. Thanks!"
"Good app for calling and screen sharing. It would be good if I can use 
Bluetooth audio channel while driving.."
I'm not sure if you remember me parece muy interesante
helpful
Annoying you can't start a meeting inside the app but overall should work fine
The picture quality was good.
good
Stops working on Meizu M3s Android 5
tnx
"Works as intended. Sound quality and reliability on 4G somewhat lower than with WhatsApp, but the app works very ok on WiFi. To those who want to switch off video: simply tap the video and then the camera icon to have an audio-only call."
After a few broken versions it works and does what it's supposed to.
Good
"I know you wwo't fragment your apps, I have nothing against this app except that I have no idea how to use it. Please help me"
good
Simple and effective. However: not compatible with tablets (why not?)
It's good
Like the idea obviously still early in launch. Needs ability to record meetings
"Not located locally, the settings were awesome."
Nice
It good
Google leads the Way Always!!!
its nice
"Great app, the ability to present directly from Google Slides is excellent. Great to see support for Android tablets has been added."
boogntod1 or shannonshulart073
"Google folks what is your major malfunction? I am a paying gapps user and I am in need of a functional app that does voice, audio, and text right now meet only does voice and video. If I set up a meeting with a client how the hell am I supposed to relay information quickly without a chat feature my clients may not be savvy enough to download google hangouts. This may be a deal breaker for me with Gapps. Please update this app with messaging ASAP"
Liked it's
Please introduce the ability to choose the quality like in the web version. Somtimes we need to choose audio only option (while driving for example) and not lose mobile data unnecessarily.
Nice app for online meeting
"Gets statically if I use it for a very long time, works great other than that."
"Awesome app, glad they finally added in chat! Can't wait to see what's next."
Short of perfect because audio sources can't be selected and there's no way to *only* join audio
"Love using Google Meet, so much so that I actually enjoy meetings now."
It's not convenient when used in phone.
Please add text chat. Top use-cases: 1) I can see you but not hear you. Please check your mic 2) Link sharing.
Ok
Goog! But I'm looking to find somboy to set me up! I cant pay cash but I will make sure are happy for helping!
"Very good performance, stable and high quality voice and video calls"
Need this on my wear os
clear video as well as audio.
Hibabe you have received this message and all copies from your computer system into which is a very good morning and ismin
"I'd like to applaud Google. Taking Hangouts and creating meet and chat is probably the best thing they can do for our small indie studio.  Obviously the only thing that is missing from this service is Hangouts chat, but that's supposedly coming soon!"
Thanks for your help
Could use text features for URLs
useful and easy. I like it for business remote communication
It works for meetings ;)
"Overall, fairly easy to use. Couple suggestions: 1) Hide participants, message list on bottom of app. It would be nice to have this option. 2) Lock screen from touches. If I need to switch to headset speaker, if I put the phone up to my ear, the notification menu almost always gets swiped. Then all kinds of mayhem ensue."
Good it serves it purpose
great
easy to use

It is a great app but it doesn't work with one of my computer with Google I have to run it with Firefox like my camera doesn't work no matter how fast my Internet connection is or even i have allowed my camera access
good app for online class.But it have some minor problems.
Best application for meeting and Group Video Call😊
Really good for online sessions.
"It's a good app, but it consumes too much of data, and need option to present screen only by host, These two things are in great need."
👌
It's good
Need a confirmation prompt when exiting to avoid leaving accidentaly.
It's good application
App is good but it consumes a lot of my data so please try to correct this.. So that the app will consume less data
Nice app

Sometimes the voice and video breaking
Good
Nice app
This aap is good
The service is good but you should add the features of sharing whiteboard and the feature of annotations
I give 4 stars because some times the video is not clear .but audio is super.
Nice app

"Hi. This is really good app for school meets but I have come here to say that on my android tablet, it doesnt give me the option of gridview layout and i tried the chrome extension but it doesnt work so Im not sure what to do,maybe you could update the app so that it can also be accessible for android too. Thanks if that was fixed i would then give this app 5 stars."
"Generally good app but sometimes it should be automatically disconnect me from meeting.And when i rejoin the meeting then it says""Rate this app"" and disconnect me ."
super
Good
Excellent
It's good app
I feel more better if i can mute someone from my side... ;-)
Excellent app
My mike and video cam turned on suddenly without my knowledge. I never wanted to turn it on. It was very embarrassing. Can someone tell me why it happened. Plus my class was disturbed and i didnt know until one of the meeting members contacted me. I never expected this
Awesome
"Good app but, always asking rating"
Always ask for Rating.please don't disturb
Best app to arrange online classes .
"L, xkp XD ko bokc"
I've tried it quite a few times but it always shows 'failed to join meeting'. What should I do?
Best App
"Well it is a great app but I consider adding like option where you can choose who you want to send a message to like private messages so that not the intire meeting can see the message for example you're want to send a message to the boss,teacher,etc. But you can't because everyone will see the message. But other than that I would rate it five-star and I recommend it to other people. Great job google!"
"This is a good app BUT .. I can't change my Name, can't Chat Personally to a participant, after sometime the previous chats vanish and can no more see them...only the new chats are then showing, no option to mute other participants. Our host is also not getting the Admit option after our participants reach 40.... also, only 50 participants in Mobile, compared to 250 in laptop or PC....why this discrimination?? Otherwise Good. But, these problems are not there in Zoom app."
"Its a good app but then I think that there should be an option for the host to mute everyone, cause its too disturbing when someone doesn't mute. But is the best app for online classes. Its Ok but then need more features. Liked it but not much to give 5 stars. Bext time I want to more features !! OK???"
Good
I gave 4 stars because I cannot rename or may be I don't know plzz help orelse 5 stars
Good App Nice One
It is a good app
Good
exits from the meeting frequently even while rating
"Good, valo, app"
Need more useful features like Zoom
I love this game
Very fantastic
The google meet is a very good software.I am really having good meetings but you should add pictures sending in the chat box.I should appreciate this work as it is easy to meet many people very easily using google meet.
its a good app but the voice could not clearly
"Simple functioning , great experience"
Nice
It's nice.. It's a very useful app for schools to conduct classes during this quarantine
Good
"I have a better experience from this app.at least 250,a huge amount of people attend in a group meeting video call which is suitable for any office and also for a student.hence i rate this app-4/5.but also some minor problems in it.the sound echo which create a problem during meeting.at last i say it's just a better platform for meeting more than any other app from goggle play store.thank you."
This app gets better when there is a recording feature in video meeting that's why I giving 4 star when there is recording facility then I give it 5 star
Showing
This app is so good but sometimes it is not coming please check that
Novice app
Good
It was a good app but inbetween of the class there are asking to rate there app
It is not that bad and good but it should have a dark mode because that will make people very happy. People like me put everything in dark mode so you should have a dark mode
Naic
Very useful and helpful but if there was dark mode for Google meet I would give five star for it. Will you bring dark mode in next updation
The learning app
Good performance
Super
Great
"It has an annoying bug that changes the audio output from the loudspeaker to the Calls Speaker when you recieve a call from phone or another app, and you need to leave the meeting and joing again and looks really unethical"
Please make it to share phone's video along with its audio while presenting as it shares only video.
It's a good app but it won't let me create a room to chat
Hope this stays available for those not using G suite
Provided us real-time visit with our medical providers.
Plsss add background change option (some plain colors) to this application then it'll become immortal beast. Other experiences are wonderful
Nice
Nice app
This is very good video conferencing app. The only problem is that sometimes delays the sound of other people. So please fix this problem. The I will give this app 5 stars.
It was good
Awesome
Please don't ask for ratings often
Need to support more than 1 full screen on app
Good but the voice is not always clear
Seems useful 😉
Not bad
Audio not clear. Good
Good
Every time during my class it asks for rating the app. I used to give full stars and then it will make me to start my class again it is so bad and I used to miss some portions....

good

Going in a good direction.
Love it
Some one let me in!!!
Is ok
Great
I just installed this like probably most people here to leave my completely useful review. I'm willing to bet most of the 1 Star reviews don't even have G Suite accounts and have NEVER even used this! Google should probably scrub these useless reviews for people to find out how the app is rated for people who actually would use this. It's a shame that so many people cluttered up the reviews and purposely are trying to bring it's ratings down just because they're butthurt about the direction Hangouts is going... Yet not even used the app they are reviewing.
great
💘 it

"Very useful app , have all awesome features"
Nice app
Bluetooth headsets have not properly working for the past 2 year. Unbelievable...
"My mobile is Samsung Galaxy s7 edge. It's brand new, audio is not working on a meeting when I use 'Internet audio' option. But I hear sound on headphones. I dont think there is anything wrong with my speakers because it works good with other apps. Please help me in fixing it."
Useless app.
It's not supported in on time last three day it does not support my mobile and also take more time connecting my laptop and first two days its work ok .but now not ok
There is no option to stop video(webcam) and to see only screen of the organiser. Due to live streaming of screen and video(webcam) the data consumption is very high. Please provide an option on listener side to stop the video(webcam) with out permission of organiser.
Not easy to share....this was not an improvement
Internet Audio calling is not reliable. Too many issues.
Mic is not working on poco f1
"Simply doesn't work, no audio."
Does not even start on Asus ZenFone 6
"Mic not working, Lenovo K4 Note."
Don't know enough
Pls give us back the old one this is rubbish
Every month getting problem
"Very disappointing experience, this app continually crashed my phone!"
If I cannot use this to get in to meetings with a password it's pretty much useless
I can't get on my sessions! It is broken!!!! Help anyone know another one can use???
"I had downloaded the app, but it's rubbish,it says not supported by a mobile device! What the hell? Wasted my data and time on this as could not get into my class! Terrible"
"Still can't share my webcam, still don't need this app!"
"Please it says user authentication error and I don't know why. I can't 
schedule a meeting."
Doesn't even open!!!
Waste app as of now. It needs lots of improvement. Sound quality is very poor.
Has issues. Need to go back to the old version.
Doesnt work on Chromebooks.
"Sorry, it doesn't even start! Crashes every single time!"
It's not working on my asus zenphone 5
"If someone in the conference has video activated, it drains my mobile data drastically. How to switch video streaming off, while still seeing the presentation?"
Finding difficult to create new Id. It says someone else os using your IP address..
"Can't schedule a meeting, only join."
"On my Mi5, whenever i join a meeting, sound of the phone goes off! Means i can't even listen to a song​!! Why this app misbehaves with everything... Please look into the issue. I have to use another phone Everytime for meeting. I am nougat now. Edit: Hi, i am not trying to listen to song while on the Gotomeeting session. I am saying that after joining and then disconnecting the Gotomeeting session, i am not able to speak or listen any sound from my phone. Even in the cellular call i am not able to hear anything. That's what my concern is. I have to restart my device and then i can place the listen to anything on phone normally. It all started when i tried to use sound recorder(in built phone application on Mi5) during a Gotomeeting session. After this incident Gotomeeting misbehaves everytime i join a session through app. Please suggest a solution."
Seems this does not have a free version just a free trial. Uninstalling.
Ok but have not been able.to install the app
terrible
It wouldn't let me into the meeting & the support team kept giving wrong info when called for help....
Please give us an option to use the old app.  This new app is bad.
"On opening the app, it closes abruptly."
Company Conf. Call
This app is so good really
Lack of video is very disappointing. Major failing as is the ability to show presentations from Android devices.  For such a major corporation this is such a let down from the Windows app
"It will allow you to join meetings and be part of them, which is nice. But there is no point logging into your account to actually host a meeting as you do not have the option to remote control other atteendes that are joining from a windows computer."
Slows down the phone... Not working over wifi ...reconnecting again and again...In the same wifi Its working fine in my PC.
"Others get echo of their voice when I login using my phone ... I have to 
stay on Mute🤐"
This one is harder to see dialoge and screen share at the same time
When I connect to phone instead of Internet no can hear me.  Also I was on a call and the was a lot of static noise.  Over all the ui is nice just wish the app worked like the old one
The old app worked fine. As soon as I installed this new version it does nothing but crash and give me errors. Very frustrating!!
"Had a business call using chromebook, but upon Sharing screen, only a black screen is displayed. No way to get it working."
Audio does not work with a Pixel unless in speaker mode or Bluetooth. Cant use headphones...
Can't download to my smartphone
This new version has no audio on a new Samsung phone. Go back to old version please. Audio still not working unless I use a headset
Even the rudimentary video of the previous version is now gone? 80% of the world users Android! Not having video function in a meeting app is pathetic and absurd!
The new app breaks the ability to dial the conference line (so VoIP only). Removes the ability to use phone camera for video conferencing.
I have a new phone (LG V10) and this app runs terribly on it. The presenter screen is unreadable due to scrambling and now when I want to mute and unmute it hangs to the point where I can't use it. I've reinstalled the app to no avail. This app needs serious work.
I am not able to open it at all! Crashing every time at the time of opening.
Please take this off the play store... This app just takes up space on your phone and that's all it does.
Not working. Stuck in opening audio. I didn't expect these types of apps from Citrix
It work on the trial and then didnt really messed up our first Oversight meeting
Fix password function please
"Never worked, 4 times downloaded and updated! 7 times reported. No use."
Microphone doesn't work on Pixel 3 XL
Am unable to record the meetings as a joiner.... Please provide the feature for mobile device as a meeting joiner.
Had depended upon this app for a critical meeting on the go. But audio did not work during the meeting. Lost critical business because of this. Old app was much better than this.
"App did not function at all. No sound, no mic function, nothing."
"While I enjoy the new calendar interface, trying to host a meeting was far easier on the previous version"
"Rubbish apps, I am hearing from the other people but I can't contribute into the conversation."
What is the purpose of an app that tells you you can only use it via a web browser on the computer. I guess we go to webex or zoom. Thanks for nothing Citrix.
Not worthy of beta
"Upgraded to this latest version and wish I hadn't, doest show all my scheduled meetings, doesn't dial conf call numbers half the time, hangs constantly. Did GTM even test this before they released it?"
Won't Download. I need this app for work and it simply won't download. I tried all the trouble shooting steps. I consider myself tech savvy but it don't work.
Unable to use this app. It crashes on launch
Pls add camera function
unable to sign in on google fi moto X4
Choice between speaker and ear piece is hidden in settings menu in 3 clicks!  Screen doesn't get turned off when I put the phone to my ear.
Doesn't work on ZTE Axon M
...
No matter how I try and fix my phone permissions there is no way to connect a video call.
"The old gotomeeting worked great, was always reliable. Then, one day they made it stop working and forced me to install this version. This one doesn't list my meetings at all, thus I can't connect when I don't have my meeting numbers written down. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."""
This Android app has serious issues with voice connectivity in the past couple of weeks. You are logged in but no voice and more difficult when connect via Bluetooth. It has made me immobile and i now need to take all the meetings from my laptop.
I have tried to install it but can't why that's i don't know please help to fix bug
Downloaded the app. Clicked on the test connection link and it said it was not downloadable......when it is.  Gave up after 20 minutes. Waste of my time.
Battery drainer in Samsung Galaxy S7
I cant share my webcam and after the recent update i cant sign in anymore.
How is this a better app than the old one? It seems half baked?
After trying to download it for 15 hours I had to give up
I could not connect the video when using the app on my android phone! It was just another phone call. Useless!
"The old app worked great. Loved it! With this one, I can't connect to our regular weekly meeting at all. It just spins and never connects. It's worthless! bring back the old one."
I can't download the app....
The old version worked fine.  This one is horrible.  I have not been able to connect at all: LG g5
"I installed this version to be able to use the guest user video feature on Android... but even the old features, such as being able to edit your name, and other settings, are missing. So, I look forward to using this with a team in the field once this is fully cooked."
"Video works on the iPad version, no idea why it can't work here when Skype and Google Hangouts have no problem."
Application crashing soon after trying to open
i tried installing this app and in beteween it got stopped. when i tried agai its not working
does not work at all
It won't let me join the meeting without downloading the app.
"When using a Bluetooth headset, muting and unmuting oneself several times will cause one's audio to no longer transmit properly, and thus no one else can hear them."
Its hard to download .
Worst app I have ever used I would have given 0 star
I couldn't do my interview because it's not compatible with android.
"App crashes without any reason when we connect to predefined meeting 
bridge. This is disturbing and not allowing to connect."
"Missed half a webinar as app would not launch. Restart, uninstall, reinstall....makes no difference. As soon as launch get an ""unfortunately stopped working"" message. A year ago it worked.  Sorry it out!"
After installation force close message was shown in Asus Zenfone
Oooo
Very bad apps it's need high internet speed
Unable to record during class
Excellent
Maha bakwas
Sorry to say not easy to enter
Bad
The worlds worst app is this. I would not happy rate this app but its necessary so I rated it. I suggest dont take this bad app not only bad but it is also consumes very much data😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😤😤😡😡😡😡
Its terrible.
Failed to work
THE WORST app for meetings and webinars. I had 3 classes on the app where each of the class had to be ended midway due to persistent screen lag and voice cracking.
Can't get my visual in and to see everyone
Frustrating
It was really hectic to install this app
Pathetic
It doesnt connect meetings Even i sit in good network It says check your network It becomrs difficult for me to listen online classes by my school if it hsppens like this
It's harmful for people...and video quality is worst... This app is asking to pay money for meeting.....
So poor network of this app
Lock down Chalu hai yar shanti se sone bhi nahi dete. 9 baje he chalu kar dete hai band Karo ye app
I am unable to download this app on phone.. all other apps are downloading except this. For the same reason I am unable to attend certain webinars.
Rubbish
Not clear audio
Nice
Not good
"This app is horrendous. I'm surprised it doesn't violate Google's TOS. It doesn't let you adjust volume. It also doesn't let you use headphones. You have 2 volume options ""speakerphone"" and ""not speakerphone"". The controls are completely incoherent. This app is truly an astounding piece of garbage."
it dont work!
Bad app...Totally dont recommend
Terrible audio reception
Nice
"This is an okay kind of app, but there are lot of glitches. Audio quality is no good."
Worse app
I hate this mf app
Good app
Facing Lot of networking issues problems
couldn't hear anything
Not like this app
Awaz bahut cut hoti hy.. meeting k doran kisi ki awaz samajh main nhi aati
Bad
Worst experience always. Third class
Worst app
"I connect to my classes easily but I face some serious issue in it. This application has alot of glitches like sometimes I can't use my mic and app developer didn't work for new users. Like how we use it and it will be comfortable and convenient for are use, some voice and image error I also face. And as I am new user of it am don't know how to use camera. You guys made a very good app but plz solve this issue as soon as possible."
Please fix following issues as soon as possible :- 1.mic turn on automatically for 3 secs after joining a meeting 2.sometime we get stuck at reconnecting. 3.there is a glitch in which we cannot hear anyone and neither open our mic and video.only we can see the video conference without audio.
Its coming meeting is full when there are only 6 members.. please repair it a kind request
"If I'm on a video conference with several people I can only see one person at a time, and that's the person who is speaking. I do not have the option to view all of the participants on thumbnails at the same time. I use a Samsung tablet and GTM does not have full functionality on it. This is not an issue with Zoom's app."
It requires too much bug fixing and new features to make it more usefull
Worst app ever!
It takes a lot of internet in screen sharing. I am unable to attend other classes
The absolute worst experience of my life... smh
Very good
Unable to download
Worst app cant switch between wifi and mobile data its show reconnecting if you have stable mobile data also really bad experience but have to stick to it due to clg
Very bad audio and video. Hardly can hear anything
The sound was not clear. Can't be music at background. Cut off frequently.
it was a superb app connected our meeting
Waste call app
On laptop its not working property... on mobile its ok.. bt not on laptop..
Video is not clear 😡😠 I have used many types to check the video ...
"Keeping the mic always on and ""muting"" it within the application is not only unsecure, unrelieable, but it causes wireless headsets to drain faster and makes the overall conversation barely hearable if you have feedback from mic to headset while the mic is enabled. It makes any environment unusable even if you are just a listetener."
It was the most useful thing for my online classes during lockdown. It's impressive. I sujest you to download this app for online meetings.
Very bad
Very annoying. Always disconnected
Poor reception
What a pos app dosen't work don't waste your time just make a in person appointment with your doctor if I could give them less then one ⭐ I would
Chinise app I don't like it
It's hang most of the time or not user friendly
It simply means that voice is getting blocked or error has come in meeting .This not a good for online classes very poor condition Solve it
It takes money to host a meeting
Even I can't sign in my account whenever I click sign in my account it still loading and shows check internet connection and try again
Not able to share sounds for videos
Bad
"Video wont work with my Lg Stylo 5. Tried several things. Zoom works, but not this app."
It 💩
bad
Worst of all. can not even sign up as a new member.there is only a sign in option.
Nothing was working
Not good so much trouble in sign in I use valid emailid but they says its unvalid .I miss my meeting
Report cheyandi mama
Consuming more data & battery

Bad
Sai charan yadav
Very Bad I am giving my password and email address but its showing wrong. Should not install this app Very Bad
Poor in all
It's a worst app in connectivity even though having a good internet network it made us to miss the classes
Worst application i have ever used
Not working I have tried many times
Worst app
Too bad
Audio not detected
Finding difficult to create new Id. It says someone else os using your IP address..
Has a lot of audio problem
Had to download for a lecture then never used it again
It consumes lots of data...
Very bad
"It's not stable enough yet. I keep losing audio - the app mutes me, but I can't unmute, have to drop and dial in again. It doesn't show me as muted in this case. Also, I haven't been able to launch/host a recurring meeting from it, have to use the GA version for that and recently wound up with two connections to the same meeting, one from each app, causing terrible audio wraparound. I also find this UI less intuitive - for example to find a list of active attendees you have to click on the messaging icon."
"The old app/version was 100x better. I am unable to use the speaker mode, the audio is buggy, people cant usually hear me when mute is off, UI is not as friendly as before, and it just seems completely untested."
"Computer audio is horrible on a Pixel 2 XL. People can't make out what I say. Must use phone audio. Also, this app is horrible when the data connection switches between cell and wifi. It can't ever reconnect even though the device is now online again with a different connection. Must stay on the same connection for the whole meeting."
I wonder why i can't video chat in my device with this app?
Ppl r nt able to hear me!! Neither on data or on WiFi...!!
Sound quality is not good also sound increase decrease button is not working
"Have audio issues. Although devs claim to fix audio with the update, the app is far from polished. Needs more improvement."
"Hi, I am unable to login to another meeting id. Please try to solve the issue"
"Didnt launch! I clicked the link in outlook and it took me to play store for installation-when the app was already installed! I missed the meeting with a client, tried to check if this thing works by using the get-ready link that comes as part of invites. It opened a browser window that said i should be on Android 4+....but i am already on 5.0.1 :(  Its a great app for PCs but i have no clues on how to make it work on mobiles. WebEx was a lot simpler; sadly at the new place they only use GTM."
Audio doesn't work on galaxy s7.. iOS app is thousand times better
Recently started to drain battery in background
"The description says you can use it on ""any"" Android tablet. It doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy. I keep getting an ""Unfortunately GTM has stopped."" I uninstalled it, tried clearing up space on my tablet, then reinstalled it. Same error. So, I tried the web version. The same error happened. I use it on my laptop all the time and it's great, but clearly it doesn't work everywhere."
No sound. Phone Number provided to receive audio did not work.
For some strange reason I can't seem to get the app to work properly. It use to work fine now it restricts me from being viewed or heard.
"Hate that I'm forced to install the app on my phone. Even though installing it may provide additional features, theose features are only valuable if you actually need then. If you're only a viewer, I stand by my original statement... its terrible to force the installation. I immediately uninstalled the application up after use, since it provides absolutely no benefit to me. My rating stays the same."
Nice job
Bluetooth headset (Bose Sound link) on Nexus 5 gives out only chatter and huge noise. Can't hear anything on the meetings. However other apps on device like music apps and youtube behave well
"The nominal case is ok but when I received a call while in a meeting the app self destructed; lost Bluetooth connection to car, couldn't use speaker of phone, MP3 player started! Completely messed up my meeting. Plus can't delegate presenter."
"When a session is in progress, I can't access my outlook so I can't reference any mail or document in my inbox while the app is running. The scheduled meeting is also not shown in the app; I need to click the link in my outlook calendar to access the meetings even when I'm the organizer."
It takes so much more to change presenter or add someone as organizer. When I add someone as organizer it boots me out every time.
"Unable to schedule meetings from the phone app. Audio is never clear from the mobile app, though my speeds exceed 50 mbps. Hence have to dial in all the time. Been a long term business customer, thinking of moving out to something else now."
Taking a very long time to down load
"It didn't mute after connecting to the meeting...it wanted to ask my email address but I couldn't complete it because the meeting started and it echoed everything in the room ... It was unpleasant to the others listening on the phone call.. So I turned off the phone. Meanwhile, I will default to phone call because it isn't responsive in this regard...it ignored the system volume"
"If i am connected to any meeting and simultaneously for any reason if i minimize the app, meeting is paused until i resume gotomeeting application"
China users can't download as it is not existing in our app store
"Great when it works, mainly when connected to car bluetooth. But when i disconnect BT, audio flip flops between speaker and phone mode crazily, when I'm not even touching. Unusable standalone.  To the feedback - my issue is when I disconnect BT. Still happening - unusable? well obviously I have to keep using it if others do, it's a truly horrible experience today. Dropped a star since you seem to not only not understand the issue but still ongoing."
I cnt download anything on this play store
"I like the previous version, always work ! Now if i sign in, i am muted, why?"
Very unstable connection and bad quality in general. Needs lot of work.
Can't join meetings with passwords... Useless
Video call option not available...
unable to connect Bluetooth headphones on mobile version.
"Considering how important this tool is to my life as a development manager on dispersed teams, I find it incredibly frustrating that GTM hasn't improved this app. A grab bag of issues: Bluetooth connections don't work with microphones. Multitasking issue that the app launches as a sub-application thus blocking access to whatever app launched it - this means that you can't look at your mail while participating in a meeting launched from email! The app can't default to Internet Audio. Can't start meetings"
Can't see and blurred
Once I turned the speaker feature on it would not turn off. Really poor design for a shipped product.
I was supposed to have a videoconference interview this morning.  Only glitch was that I did not send any video.  Fully received the organizers video.  Did not have any options or buttons for video on my side.
You can't sign into your profile to start (host). The design is much nicer but the functionality is just not there. To be honest learn from the zoom app.
The webcam feature is not working on my phone (P20 Pro). It shows a webcam preview but then when you click share it does nothing and closes the webcam preview. Calling support did not help. Any suggestions?
"Poor experience with the app. Could not connect audio despite being on a very good network. The app has a default setting of speaker on, which doesn't make any sense. So when the meeting starts, it directly starts on speaker mode. I had a hard time connecting Bluetooth to listen in on the meetings.  Overall, a real let down."
"Previously I used to join meeting through MEIZU M2 note mobile.. Now I am using VIVO V7+  ..now I am not able to join meeting as its shows a error message as ""This meeting is not supported on mobile so please join through computer"".. So please help to join.."
App starts up randomly using battery even when not in use... spyware? Uninstalled..join.me is better and doesn't do that stuff
"We have regularly meetings with password protection, this new version tells me to use desktop clients = useless. Also the audio controls are hidden in submenu accessible through just small icon in corner = usability hit. New version = step back..."
poor
Far too long.   What happened to phone option only
"The app is seriously short on options, I don't want webcams I want 
presentations, I can't turn off webcams."
"Disappointing that the app doesn't support meeting passwords. I have to launch the old version, which alerts me it's outdated, just to join password-protected meetings. It also did not offer to remember recurring meetings (unlike the previous edition) which is inconvenient."
Do have option to personalise the self information like older version
"When I received a telephonic call during the webinar, microphone to the app 
was not turned off automatically. It turned out to be an embarrassing 
situation."
Many features are missing from older one. Most notably remembering reoccurring meetings. Calendar integration is a nice idea but not all of us have work email/calendars set up on our personal phones. Seems more like a forced public beta than a new version of the app.
"Very buggy application. Using it with my Samsung Galaxy S7. Like other users I experienced lots of issues when Google Play upgraded me to the new app but did not remove or overwrite the existing version of the app.  Also, calls frequently fail when dialed from inside the app and app randomly fails during calls, disconnecting the phone call."
Two meetings and can hardly hear with speaker on.
cut you off when somebody calls and completely messes up the call. Should have the ability to disable incoming calling or somehow suppress callers from being able to completely interrupt a meeting.
I wasn't able to log in with my main email address and was told I have to use another email address I used when first signing in. Anoying.
"It's  a good app for audio conversation... But this app doesn't support in my phone (symphony w68)... Is there any solution for me?? Or, what can I do???"
"Blocks the speaker even if the meeting is finished, disconnects if someone calls during the meeting. I wish I wasn't forced to use that app..."
Meeting is not able to be conducted on the phone and is asking for computer
No option for video chat. Galaxy S7 Edge.
Like it
I can't get my Webcam to pull up when I am in a meeting. What do I do because it doesn't even give me the option to.
Brand new s7 edge. Whenever I try to join a meeting it hangs with the joining spinner up.
In the old app everything worked fine. Now with the new one I can no longer use Internet audio via speaker phone. It only works if in call in. That defeats it's purpose for me as I work in an area with very little cell reception.
It doesn't work
no recording option seen for attendees
"I'm surprised that this has such high ratings considering the app is absolute garbage. The audio is so unreliable that we just ask the meeting attendees to call via traditional phone. The video is buggy and slow. Audio is not compatible with Plantronics headset. Compared to other similar apps like WebEx or Ring, this is a shameful app."
zero
Audio disconnect/reconnect frequently
Too much time to down load
"After last update, application crashes randomly anytime and exits meeting automatically. If I am an organizer, I need to make someone else organizer or else everyone will get exited from meeting. Bad impression to client calls and meetings."
"Keeps cutting out, posts names of people speaking incorrectly."
Facing connection issues from past two weeks. Not able to connect with calls.
Everyone was seeing each other and instructions so everyone was working with only half a screen
IT IS NOT GIVEN AS FREE PLS GIVE FREE
I can't get the free trial
"Anyone know how to get tiles of all callers on android? It keeps flipping back and forth to each individual caller. Very difficult to deal with. Makes be dizzy. Works fine for iPhone and iPad attendees and works on my PC, but bad experience on my Samsung android. Any suggestions?"
Good
Trying to open the app and type in a meeting ID starting with 191 after I typed 19 it would put go meet. Me before the number and added an extra 119 the more I typed the more numbers where are duplicated however if I run the button on the website and then it opens the app it goes to the correct meeting but doesn't work when you type the meeting number directly into the app
Video quality is horrible & not realtime clear audio. I've gd enough internet connection.
"With the android app, you only can see who is talking and no one else. The host can mute you but cannot unmute you."
Poor
It took over 10 minutes to download onto my phone if it was quicker if would have given more stars
Very bad
"As it only shows the current speaker, it constantly switches the video from one to another. This is very annoying and makes it useless if there are a few people having a conversation. Until this is fixed it's a poor app."
"Cumbersome Edit 4/22/20: the app was cumbersome...very weighted slow,overintensive,quality was deff lacking. Just not for me."
Very slow
When typing into the search bar the auto fill would double everything I typed rendering it useless.
You can only see webcam of one person
Good it's easy to contact team meeting and conversation...
Very slow app
For how many meetings free trials are available???
Even after downloading this app i cant able to open the app
Gud
Im trying to put my information email &PW is not accepted. Trato de poner mi información y no me lo aceptan. Sorry.
"Didn't allow me to see attendees in video mode all at once, it would just keep jumping between people and it made me dizzy"
Plz mention how participants can participate in this app
Doesn't have a good quality video and audio.
After the Update Now i always get a lot of bugs like the audio comes at the same time when someone speak but the video come after 1-2min.... And Some time audio is not coming (Saying connecting to audio)..... only video play All the things are good before...but now i facing lot of problems... I want to roll back..pl provide me this option. Thnak u..

How many can participate in meeting?
How many people can join at once
"one attendeee chat with another attendeee is shown to organizer , it is wrong. Change it. Thanx for reaching my prblm"
It's a good app but consumes a lot of bandwidth even for audio meetings. Its manadatory to have high speed internet otherwise app keeps disconnected
I have an android and during the meeting it flips back and fourth from everyone trying to talk; it's annoying. Good thing i don't have epilepsy. Apparently the iPhone version doesn't do that and has seperate boxes for each person. If the android version does have that option please let me know how to change it.
Awwful 38 minutes to download
Very interesting and meaningful.
Okk
Not as user friendly or transparent as other platforms Update. I have used zoom am and life that I could see clearly who was logged in . And how to put all pictures on screen. With this I could not. People could see me I couldn't see them. Even though they had camera on. Very disconcerting
Two out of four of us kept having connection issues. Either the camera wouldn't work or the mic wouldn't.
Video quality is not good
Screen kept switching between participants. Very distracting
Terribly poor setup.
"Response rate is too low, previous version was wuite good, 5 star for it."
It is lagging and it freezes and keep someone to update and it goes to a hundred now to 22% not happy
Terrible
Very poor quality

Audio is gud .. but couldn't keep up with display or screen .. which results in mis gap of communication 🙏
Wow
Why is there caller 01 showed up at my meeting?
"The audio was in and out (might be connection issues). The video seemed eratic in transitions, not smooth. The management interface does not seem as intuitive and functional as Zoom. I'm disappointed."
My company uses this app for meetings and other remote sessions. It works well for most things. A simple meeting face to face or over the phone with many in the company this does very well. The problem is the inability to play a video with sound during a meeting. In many instances this has been needed but not possible with Go To Meeting.
New trying to learn the system..
"Picture jumps around, no gallery view option. Lots of static for no apparent reason."
"Gritty, kept losing signal"
our school'meeting is held on this app its good but again and again says that trying to re connect even in full range sometimes mic stops working and the qualityof video is not good at all
Good
App interface is very good. But facing audio disconnection issues every 1 or 2mins causing interruption in the course lectures. There is no internet problem the network is good. Also uninstalled and installed the app twice still the problem persists. Request to please look into the matter. Thank you
It is not free
Can't see all of them in one screen and video quality is to low. I send a mail to your feedback mail id. Pls check it
Good app in this tough period but video quality is not good

Can't use bluetooth headset during a meeting

I would love to as a guest change my background our group is paying for it and others I have used let you
Everyone listen i really didn't like this app at a tall because it is so confusing app if you agree please do yes and not then sure do no as your wish guys
Dont luke bing on phone or a computer this long
Very bad
Jumpy. Would randomly repeat number entries. Camera did not share properly.
Don't share vedio
I couldn't attend a meeting. It was telling me network error
Not good
"Takes a heavy toll on the hardware. Phone with 4GB ram is barely enough to make it work for an hour before it overheats. Not recommended unless you own a top notch phone/tablet, better stick to the pc version"
Very poor during online...
Nice apl
Ok..hoping for better luck this week..doesnt seem very organized..
Cannot be found ? Why.
How do we sign up for host a meeting for free. There is no provision for new user to sign up
"Audio is horrible ,,,problematic"
"I is good for only 2 3 days, then it starts having audio-visual problems and sometimes automatically closes the meeting 👎👎👎👎👎🖕🤮"
I lost chat option by update in February 2020
Inconsistent. Unable to share camera as presenter and attendee unable to share camera. Have used twice before same attendee with camera fine. What's up.
IT SUCKS
Good
It is not responding for me
No experience
Costly
It is very worst...it is very slow....we can't send any ppt it is very tough for us
"Cumbersome Edit 4/22/20: the app was cumbersome...very weighted slow,overintensive,quality was deff lacking. Just not for me."
Still no gallery view on android.

"While connecting meeting, i am always facing problem like i cannot see the screen, some reconnecting message is displaying even i am connected to the meeting. Please help me out with this."
Bad login struggle
I can't make it to see everyone at the same time. I can see only the person speaking at the moment
Www/its.52com
I couldnt find an option to send individual id's to participants pls give me reply
How many people can join at once
"I first kept it on installing mode, then when i again looked at it so it says that to install it again. Then i again kept it on installing mode and the same thing happened again. Please look into the matter! And please reply me fast."
Its not making new account . And always show that the password or email is invalid Even when we are using correct password and email. So i cannot rate it untill unless i will use ..
I love this app but what annoys me sooooo much is that i cant look at everyone at the same time on android. Also it flashs and hurts my eyes. I would recommend put an option where you can see everyone at the same time. Pls fix this fast
Alot of disconnection in audio
Today the internet was consumed like anything...it took 1.5 gb in just an hour...everyday it takes 300-500mb and today it took my whole internet of 1.5 gb Please resolve the issue

"Work from the car a lot and whenever I try to use Bluetooth on car stereo with this app, everything gos silent. All other BT cases work fine. Seems like a common scenario for most business people."
Can do better if audio quality improved
It was a fantastic experience to meet with friends through this app..

"No camera support, I could see others but no one could see me I tried on note 5 and edge"
I'm Not sure !
New interface is less user friendly.  I use Outlook for Android and it does not link/find my calendar goto meetings.  Major PIA...
"Pixel 3 user here. Can't speak unless I'm connected to a Bluetooth headset. Tried headphones, speaker, etc. Never worked. Only Bluetooth worked. Same happened with my Pixel 1"
No support for password like the old app. Otherwise it's a nicer interface
"The new ui is great, but it's connection to identity management is crap. I'm fine to jump into a meeting I'm invited to, but I can't host a meeting more often than not because it doesn't recognise me as signed in. I might be based on where I'm located. If so, you need to widen the geographical locations of your directory."
nice audio quality. Video with interruptions.

"When I join a meeting it defaults to speaker ""On"" which is fine, but only a barely audible gargling sound comes out. I have to quick switch the speaker off and then I can hear the meeting. But not being able to use the speaker on my phone is really annoying. I'm using an S7."
On line meetings
Notfinished yet
Disconnects when I go to other apps unlike the older versions. I cant read my skype messages while meeting is ongoing. Not sure if it is just with the note 5. But all in all it does not allow me to do my work on phone efficiently anymore.
trial?

"The app can't transfer sound via Bluetooth, it just doesn't swich the channel. When somebody phone you, it goes muted, but doesn't unmute back! Finding how to turn on the sound became a problem..."
Good
I i will see
App keep crashing when try to share screen.
...
"Seems to remember meeting IDs now. The switch for ""mute me when the meeting starts"" is confusing, have to guess whether it's on or not. Video during the meeting is glitchy, different feeds pop in and out sporadically with ugly glitches in between."
Could not get the audio to play through my headphones. Only through the phone speaker. Not ideal.
It will be in view mode with speaker on the but the mic is set to phone so no one can hear me and they say I'm way too soft. You need to have mic pick up like speakerphone mode when you're viewing the screen and the speaker is on. Obviously. Frustrating glitch.
"There  are a sound issue in this app, the audience cannot hear my voice, can you solve this issue?"
good ease of access but no interaction on my end so it's a bit hard to rate.
Please put a double tap option on the screen through which we can forward the recorded videos by 10 seconds whenever we want... Just like YouTube.
Great
"trying to install this app on my computer, but it will not let me. It notices my other devices, but not this one. Any suggestions?"

good
Could not find any option to record the meeting using this app on my tablet.. I could record on my laptop
Better interface that the old app. Would prefer if it automatically used phone instead of Internet when you aren't connected to the internet. Well see how Citrix continues to update the app but for now it's a step up from the old version.
Good
"it will be good , if we can get keyboard and mouse control for mobile"
its good
Using could be easier
The app doesn't install
Naturals
Would be better if they allowed for screen sharing on mobile device
The volume for audio not available very low. You try to raise the volume it raises the phone volume for calls
"It's ok, but it has a nasty bug. Persons that connect to the conference using the Android app, never get logged as attendees, thus they will never show up as participants to conferences in the History section on the website. It's like they don't exist at al, which is a shame if you want to use the history section for anything useful (such as worktime tracking)."
"A good start, can share your phone screen but can't pass control to someone else in the meeting to allow them to share their screen. That's a big failing."
superb
nice

I have only used it once and so far so good.
"sorry sir,but I experiences that the app lags or hangs under high speed internet."
"My company uses this all the time and for some reason there is no front camera. This is silly in the day and age where apps like Skype let you share your screen, video chat etc."
great 👍 job
"Muting the phone's audio does not mute the audio (pixel 2 xl). I had all volume settings disabled and it was still playing audio from the speaker. You have to navigate through the settings within the app and disable audio there. Besides that issue, it's been pretty good."
I am not able to understand how to chat with other attendees once I joined a meeting....plz someone help me with this
It is nice app
It's good but not very good

We will see

Hopefully, in a few days, I can get back in there & use the app. Was: I'm trying to sign up for Airmid Yoga online classes, but I erroneously signed up for a free trial with GoToMeeting, which is now going to charge me monthly. I do not want this to happen. Please remove me from paying for something I don't need."

"Works for conference calls. If you are having a video conference call on the android app, the screen only shows the video of the mic talking. With 6 people the screen flashes between pics so much that it gives you a headache. I have heard the apple app allows you to see all people (up to 6) on the screen at once. Please fix the android app to do the same."
Very boring UI but has a lots of features.
Great user exprience
"Is verf simple to use,only issue is if a group of ppl r there the voice echoes,only 1 can speak and others have to mute mic"
Very good
Very good
Thanks you
Video quality is just ok. Internet connection is pretty fast but it never seems to improve. Audio is good but it's also annoying that if I'm doing a meeting on a tablet I can't see anyone that isn't talking. There isn't any option to change the video view at all.
Audio was not very clear. Maybe due to attendees mics not being muted.
Good
Unable to see other than one other participant at a time. No settings option on my green video icon other than stop screen sharing. Need the option to view other participants. Seems to work on apple products but not android.
The app auto fills the meeting ID incorrectly. Every time you edit the mistakes it continues to auto fill incorrectly. Repeatedly have to correct the mistakes.
This app is not able to down loading. Gone through the play store Clicked The app but not been downloaded What r the reason Srikant

Which often interferes with hearing what other person is talking on the other side, it is very disturbing . i tried uninstalling & installing again thinking that it might need an update. I kindly request for this issue in this app to be looked into."
I am still trying to see how I can use it and how optimal it is. So far so good
Attendance issue & audio is not proper..
Perfect
Good app.
Well enough.
Not a bad app
Overall the experience is good but I would like the ability as a presenter to mute all the attendees directly from my phone as they dial in. This seems to be available only from the desktop version. Would appreciate if that feature would be available. Thanks.
"I saw others communicating to the presenter, but it seemed unavailable to me on this tablet. It was difficult to control the volume on tablet speaker or headset. Headset volume control seemed to be blocked...way too loud!"
Iska audio bohut accha hai magar video ko improve korna parega
"My experience was good,though have given only three 🌟, the number of people to join the meeting should be recommended. In this meeting I attended we were close to 70+ participants and in various locations, others as far as 50Kms. So issues of controlling the meeting and intermittent internet network, could probably affect quality of deliberation in such a meeting with large number of participants."
Best settings master on the map
It doesn't work
Still learning the new format of GoToMeeting.
Why can't this be downloaded to a note 5?!
Best
It was goof while it lasted but i cant set up meetings any more
I'm still in confusion if the host can see our faces even if the video option in attendees phone are switched off.. Do they see when we share it?? Or the whole time (android app)
Zoom offers 40 minutes of meeting time for free with their basic membership. The basic membership with zoom is free. $0.00 and I still get 40 minutes continuously for free. That's enough for me.
"This app is awesome. But has some issues with the audio, it gets automatically red, green and sometimes white. So plz do something about it."
"The app works fine, only when I use my wifi. It's not working if I connect my tablet to phones Hotspot and use it. Please help me fix this."
Sir it doesn't wrk it displays please correct the network connection while using with data connection
I was not able to sign in
Hi. We regularly use this app. Its quite good. Only problem we have is when using mobile app tat time in video conference we can only the one who is talking and others cannot be seen like laptop. If this feature is added that during video conf at least 4 faces can be seen together in one screen then it will help us
Nice
"Audio problem while using bluetooth earphones. I dont understand the link between bluetooth and the meeting. When i have attended the meeting and tried to listen using bluetooth earphones, the app is unable to recieve internet and is getting disconnected. It frequently shows waiting to reconnect although my internet is stable. Hope u fix this bug in the next update."
Good
"Would love it if you were supported on cromebooks. Camera share used to work but doesn't anymore. Requires 2 devices to work, one phone for audio and the cromebook for video."
This is very useful for all the persons so i request you to all the person install in your mobile
"This app is great 🙂 but...the camera is not really that good ☹️And, I am not eligible to sign in so the app doesn't work that much😭But overall, it is a great app"
Bad Application processing is Not Good High Network Capacity required
Sound kept going off and it was hard to hear the instructor and others. It also didn't let you see others and talk with them.
Nothing special
"This app ok for the most part. The only thing is I wish the mobile app allowed us to see everyone's camera during a conference call. On apple, you can see everyone on the mobile app but on the android, you can only see the person. Please fix this!"
Good
Some times it takes time to reconnect.
Did not install on my tablet desktop.
In Gmail account iam typing right password but it is showing that s wrong in this app please help me
Not as much good...it's not mean that it is bad...it is better than zoom
Thank You For Meeting Apps.
A CC the p v get a I u yx you y
Very nice aap
Heats a bit
"Very poor sound quality, hardly able to hear 50 /60 % of Webinar"
The app itself is acceptable for what it is used for in my company. However the quality of sound is something that needs to be improved. Way too many times people speaking or interrupted by static or simply cut off. If This Were to be fit I would change my rating to a five
Lags heavily when there is over 10 members in a meeting.
"It is not easy, it takes a very long period to download the application."
Was different.
"I use this app for meetings but I experience lot of disturbances such as garbling of voices, interruptions & difficulty in hearing. It's horrible sometimes."
"The app is great. I use it for my workouts with my sports team and it is very helpful, especially right now. There is an issue though. As I said, I am in a call with my team, about 45 people, and I can only see the person who is talking. And there is no option to see the other people on the call. This is probably because I am using a Samsung Tab. Zoom, however, does not have this problem. This kind of sucks and I would like this to be fixed, please. Not a big problem, but anything helps. Thanks!"
"Connections on off, and one never worked with same system as other..."
Good
Good
Audio issue
Automatically the Mike is muted and unmuted it is a disturbance while listening to other person
Camera wouldn't work/share
"Go to meeting is good, it is some how good with limited participants. The success of the meeting depends on the organizer who has to mute and unmute the audio and vedio of the participants."
Wonderful
"Tried on a android phone, could not send video, had alot of trouble with audio"
Boring
Nice
बहुत ही अच्छी सहायता के लिए के माध्यम मिटिंग की सुविधा है
"The app is okay, just that people can't see me, but i can see them, can it be fixed please"
Very good app
Superb app khali recording hone chahiee
Good
Voice was fluctuating with video
How to stop subscription before the trial ends??
Try something more......make sure you have to give the better experience to the user.so the most important thing is to control the meeting with slow internet also.You also think more to get 5 star....
Good
Not audiable
Good
Sound not clear
Video quality...?
I have never been able to use this app ever since i downloaded it and is very furstating it keep saying try again
"Good, but become unreachable without wi-fi."
"This is great... But not than zoom... In zoom there is hand option and many.... But in this just chat.,settings, mic , webcamera, account"
"Reception is laggy, doesn't always work but good tool when it does"
"Easier than I thought, not used to technology"
Can't understand other person very well.
"some days voice and video does not sync up. i have 30MBps connection it keeps on lagging when it lags its not due to the speed of the connection,bcoz other applications work fine"
Nice
Even when we get good internet connection some times it keeps on showing reconnecting reconnecting and it unmutes everytime when we try to login again
When I am opening Go to meeting in my laptop Mozilla Firefox is opening despite downloading the app in my laptop
Dont like that I cant see other attendees. Dont like that when others talk theres a weird background noise when they 1st start speaking.
I wish we could get more pictures of attendees during the mtg.
Fine but I couldn't see the family we were talking to.
I connect with my brother at a nursing home where there are visiting restrictions. They srt it up so I can use my phone or my ipad. I do appreciate this so much during this pandemic. Sometimes the connection is slow. I do use it to provide as many varied activities as possible.
Gud
Easily crash when use with ipad
Audio very clear nice
"Very poor sound quality, hardly able to hear 50 /60 % of Webinar"
Sound quality is not good. Sometimes disturbances in video
Doesn't give organizer or presenter control to mute attendees. Mobile app doesn't allow you to view all.
not getting download
I have to go to school
Cannot close video or see everyone on link only speakers.
Good app
Good
"Hard,to get Into group.took over 45 minutes. People kept getting kick out. Some didn't even get visual, only sound. This was a special needs dance. I kicked out of 2 computers. 1 was a chrome . Both computers are new. 1 week old, and the 2nd is 3 weeks old. Even thing was flashing and crashing. Every time you log on, it try's to make you down load Program. When things open,up, I will not do anything virtual"
Satisfactory.
"It is good app during this lockdown season for student and teachers to held their meetings but have some problems regarding this that I can't hear the voice of teachers even in full network , mike problem and video problem."
Convenient
Ok
Okay
Horrible video feed
Good than zoom
Cool
In order to take a screenshot i need to minimize the screen. In order to send a message I need to maximize the chat function which covers part of the instruction. If I was able to send a message and take a screenshot without having to make changes to the screen instructor I would rate 5.
Nice app
"This app is good, but not that as so as zoom.. The reason iam saying this because,it does not have any hands rising option video and audio issues and so on.. I think zoom as greater than this.. Its secured,eerything are there in zoom"
Good performance but needs improvement
can't it open on PC?
This app is better than other video conferencing app bcoz in this the operator who arrange the meeting do not want to accept the request of other persons who wants to attend the meeting so time is not wasted to add the persons in the meeting.
Good
Good
I couldn't download
It is not getting fast installation
This app isn't clear. But sometimes good.
"Im on a chrome book and cant use the drawing tools, they do not show up. How do I sort this out?"
Unable to sign in.says wrong email and password
"So--Far So--Good ! It's my 1st time and I want to used again so I can rate it properly. But I repeat; So--Far. So--Good! Thanks, sure I'll use it again ! !"
Good
Not very satisfying!
Required better coordination
No clarity of video and the voice is not visible
Takes Too much time for download
Heats a bit
Make it free to host.
Guu khayega
Easy and best in slow connection
Very nice aap

Work very nicely I like this app
Knowledgable but needs improvement on reception
The app auto fills the meeting ID incorrectly. Every time you edit the mistakes it continues to auto fill incorrectly. Repeatedly have to correct the mistakes.
Voice may be improved in this app.
Video quality is just ok. Internet connection is pretty fast but it never seems to improve. Audio is good but it's also annoying that if I'm doing a meeting on a tablet I can't see anyone that isn't talking. There isn't any option to change the video view at all.
"Is verf simple to use,only issue is if a group of ppl r there the voice echoes,only 1 can speak and others have to mute mic"
Unable to see other than one other participant at a time. No settings option on my green video icon other than stop screen sharing. Need the option to view other participants. Seems to work on apple products but not android.
Good
Audio was not very clear. Maybe due to attendees mics not being muted.
Very good
Thanks you
Very good
Hope it improves soon
Unknown to me
Nice app for study
Very boring UI but has a lots of features.
Good
"Works for conference calls. If you are having a video conference call on the android app, the screen only shows the video of the mic talking. With 6 people the screen flashes between pics so much that it gives you a headache. I have heard the apple app allows you to see all people (up to 6) on the screen at once. Please fix the android app to do the same."
Great user exprience
Keep losing app
Was fantastic - not used for some time
Look forward to more meetings
Paytm App not opened untill uninstall this App
Easy to navigate through.
"It was not digitally as good as I expected, but that maybe due to the quality of the equipment we are using. But it was a great way to Worship together during the world wide crisis we are now experiencing. Praise God in this storm. He is in control. ✝️"
"Ok meeting app, video quality is not that good so its hard to do online lessons"
nice apps online jobing
"Update: Based on the quick & very pleasant reply from LogMeln, Inc, below, I've changed to a 3* rating. Due to illness, I'm unable to do online yoga classes right now. Hopefully, in a few days, I can get back in there & use the app. Was: I'm trying to sign up for Airmid Yoga online classes, but I erroneously signed up for a free trial with GoToMeeting, which is now going to charge me monthly. I do not want this to happen. Please remove me from paying for something I don't need."
It really difficult to join on my Android phone
"Needs dark mode. It is not clear how to find meetings, or become a presentor"
The app takes time to load
Mofos delete this application before my college start taking online classes
"I am experiencing problems in connecting my wireless headset to my windows laptop. This is not the problem of the headset connectivity issue with the laptop, it works fine. The problem only occurs with ""Go-to meeting"" application in Windows desktop version. The audio is not audible. I hope your team will address this soon."
Ok
Good application
Good
Lovely
There should be automated sub titles popping out
Cool and good to go
Good
Cant join at scheduled time why?
Good
it is fairly clear and free....good for interviews and group sessions
GTM should have toll free india dialing number too.
Connects and works but can't adjust streaker volume. All Android volume settings muted and it's screaming loud! Speaker on off is buried on settings instead of on the main screen.
It's not intuitive
Very nice
Cut out
I don 't know for wille

"This was my first GoToMeeting and it was very interesting! I would do this again but i need to learn the functions, as far as, like the camera, mute, ect..."
love it
first time use
"the sign in for Company Account doesnt work. please have a look. thanks! yes, of course i am authorized to. i'm not redirected to my company login page. the button is dead."
video and voice is very clear
they're trying
It was just a little noisy.
ehen you finally get the camera share right on the lap top it is a good tool go to meeting app.
Exceptional!
good and better way to communicate
Not able to connect through bluetooth earphones!

cuts off every now and then very poor network connection... but it is of such big help. just needs to be improved even the sound.
Good one
Ease of use
Wonderful App
Great for meetings

"Works wonderful,  very powerful for a cell phone app. There are some bugs with audio,  but usually I get through it. This is a must have for me and my business."
It's great. Can listen & participate in a meeting no matter where I am.
GotoMeeting is wonderful aap...thanks a lot Citrix...you are making things happen online whereever we are...
Helpful
Good wrk at all
Once i got used to I found it easy to use
"Works well with simple interface, just need ability to hide ""Who's talking"" overlay in full screen mode.  But takes a lot of space - seems like a very large app for what it does..?"
Very good app.. It provides a lot of ease for professionals to attend meetings just by a single tap
Awesome experience!
O.k but I could not call in during the meeting session.
Great App. A+
Its a very effective way of communication!
ok..but has a lot of sound related disturbances
Its a great app to connect with Vend
Never had a glitch. Awesome experience in professional meetings and conferencing.
Good informative..!!

"This worked out great! I had a weak cellular connection but saw & heard everything just fine! I followed the link to download the app from the Play Store; once I returned to the message, I was connected to the meeting session. Quick & painless!"
Excellent
Nice app for meetings
Good Application
"Great app. Can be used everywhere and anywhere provided you have internet

Go To Meeting is a user friendly app. It provides visual and auditable and a easy navigational sense to the fingertips. Quick and easy leads to a great productive meeting.
First time using this. Easy to download and comment. Not use all functions but good way to listen and get involved in the meeting.
Review in the making
Very clear audio to conduct phone interviews
Good and easy to use
Good software for conference calls..
Just Excellent and Perfect!! Best Meeting App.
How to use chat option?
phone resolutions can be prohibitive when documents need to be shared within the meeting... focus on tablet/desktop/laptop use
I enjoyed it
Very convenient
"In every human device, always room for improvement."
quite interesting and challenging.
"Everything is fine. It should add feature to make a audio conference 
outside US phone number... A simple call me button on given phone number"
very nice
"While a disaster with the new launch, this business essential looks to be working reliably again."
"Excellent to use although I had a slow start installing it on my phone, but it ultimately worked so well"
Pretty decent web conference software
Very convenient. Like the chat feature. Sound quality needs improvement.
Much better interface and glad to see integration with calendar.
Not sure
UI can be much more user friendly
not able to launch on zenfone7
Good to a certain degree
Great app
Wonderful app for meetings. Totally recommended
Excellent tool for collaboration and business development purposes.
Very clear call! No issues whatsoever and it's a great to way to hold groups meetings

"Today'agresión was very good, audible fans noise free."
Clean clear voice. Interface easy to use with no trouble.
Very sincere and informative! Lost signal a few times.
Great for a conference call!
Not bad for conf calls

Very easy to use and efficient in its purpose.
Really works cool. Some functioning with voice quality can be improved further.
Still evaluating.

Excellent performance in clearance of app must download
Great work app & tool.
Great App!
Good
User experience should be enhanced more. Overall good to use.
Good connection and coordination
please provide feature to record meetings.
"Easy to use. Only downfall is if someone is using their camera, you get stuck staring at their face. I did not find a way to take that off."
experience was good...
Good. In low net connectivity it's working perfectly
Very convenient.
Convenient. Volume could be better.
Perfectly good
"The sound was quite good, but at some points became so unclear I couldn't 
make out what was being said. I'm not sure if this was just a connection 
problem though."
Missing to see list of attendees on call.. it only shows current speaker but not who all are in call 😞
Good
Good app
Simple & Easy to use
I was impressed Can somebody tell me how to get out of the trial
Good app that very helpful to New user
"Excellent quality and ability to converse and share information. My only reason for not giving 5 stars was I wish there was an ability for participants to be able to vote. Other than that, GoToMeetings is excellent from a network security and professional platform perspective."
good app
Very good
Simplified user interface
It good as long as people mute there mics when not talking else its video crazy on the screen.
"This app is very good for video conferencing. But sometimes there are glitches in the video. So, it would be better if these are rectified and it would be better if raise hand and polls are included in the app."
Excellent
Very effective

There was a lot of static and the call dropped. Took two times before getting in.
Good one..easy
Some minor glitches...freezing up and unable to connect fully..i.e j can see and hear the other person but my audio and video won't connect. Overall decent app
"We have been successful with a few meetings and although sometimes video is choppy or sound is off, generally this app is an effective and efficient meeting place."
While sharing videos..the volume is poor. There is a great problem during sharing. Rest it is good.I like it . If the video issue is not solved then I will have stop using the app.
"Very good system. My only problem is, it would be nice to have a caller ID in place or be able to sync with contact information."
Great
There was a slight disturbance in my last call.

This app is good for studies and office work 👍👍👍
"Good, Easy to access"
I had to switch to my phone's version because the browser version on my laptop failed!
I had a split scree the whole time instead of just a small box of the person talking even when the video was played.
Good app for sharing w multiple people

"First time use, was a great usage...lol"
"Video was jumpy to whomever was speaking, rather than showing multiple screens at once. This can be confusing. Otherwise, the feed was good, sound quality and video quality were good."
Connected with some difficulty. But once connected it was ok.
Good. Sometimes Audio was problem.
Very nice
Good
It's good for conference meeting..
There is an issue with audio reception...audio fluctuations are frequent with low network signal (mobile data)
Even if we are coming out of the app its better if this app allow us to continue the meeting...it ll be easy for using other applications at the same time and most students will support you guys..😅⁸
"Great, so convenient. Meetings made easy.  Again you can be sure that at any time, whatever meeting you have planned, take it as done once you have thIs app. Good to go at anytime regardless of location, time."
This is an excellent app. works well with mobile. you don't feel that you are out of office. Good work.
Lovely app
"Easy to use and deploy, excelent connectivity (audio, visuals, etc) and great support"
It works pretty well right out of the box with very little configuration.

"Teachers loved how easy it was to use, and how it links up. Parents also thought it was easier to use as well which is a plus. "
"It has been a very positive experience despite the glitches. Every year, Google improves Google Classroom. "
"I've used this software for long and it's very good. I've used it often in school. Very easy to use, and you just need a google account to log in. Awesome and I can really recommend it! 7/10"
Our overall experience with Google classroom is favorable.  We have used it in conjunction with our 1:1 technology initiative with student issued Chromebooks.  We have no plans to switch products at this time
"I really enjoy using Google Classroom to get information out to my students quickly.  It is my Homebase for all of my websites, information, assessments, files, you name it.  My students know to go there for links to everything."
"Overall, Google classroom works nicely as a supplemental classroom tool for digital work. It gets the job done even if it lacks a few small features. I plan to continue using it whether those features are added or not due to the ease of setup and management for teachers and students. "
I've realized that this is a great way to group students and evaluate them.
AMAZING. Very user friendly/ kid friendly. Very aesthetically pleasing and not overwhelming! 
"It's user friendly, FREE, and I had no problems with it whatsoever. "
Google Classroom was very useful to me as a college student that depends on out of class work and studying. So this app was overall amazing.
"Google Classroom has become an essential part of my graduation. The ease and speed with which teachers can post assignments, reading materials and classes, in addition to the interaction between students and teachers, make Google Classroom a great ally of our studies, and its relevance is even more evident in these times of social detachment and quarantine."
"My overall experience has been very positive.  It's made facilitating classes much easier, and has allowed students to do more work when it's the best timing for them.  In our specialized school we deal with a lot of absenteeism, and Classroom helps to manage that issue much better than what I was using before."
Google Classroom is a wonderful way to distribute writing assignments to my whole class and comes complete with spell check to make the editing process all the easier for my learning writers. I express particular gratitude for the speech-to-text feature that I know I will be using for a long time to come.
"I have been using Google Classroom in my middle and high school classrooms since its early beta stage.  I can tell you with 6 different preps in a school day, this is a great way to keep myself and my students organized and on task."
"Overall, I have found that this software has absolutely changed the way I teach.  I am able with the click of a button to send my students assignments, video links, study guides, and other resources essential for their learning.  It also makes it easier for parents to interact with their child's education and puts them in more of a position of power to help."
"My overall experience with Google Classroom has been extremely rewarding. I have saved so much time, paper, and energy which allows me to improve the quality of my assignments and teaching while I can interact with students in real time, monitor their work, and quickly see who has submitted work. I love that it is accessible on any device and it makes my job so much easier. I love that it has decreased paper wastage immensely and I would highly encourage teachers to utilize Google Classroom as it is certainly a game changer."
"Google Classroom is a must for any classroom with the technology to support it. Its easy implementation and connection to so many other tools, this will be a hub for your students and create an easy structure for your class - not to mention it is free AND a green solution!"
"Overall, I find Google classroom extremely user-friendly for all ages and levels of experience. It is very easy to upload assignments and documents. The fact that it is compatible with so many other websites makes it a huge plus in my book. If it would just add a few more customization tools, it would be the perfect platform to utilize within the classroom or through distance learning. "
"As a student, it's really hard to create better self management when it comes to managing the whole bunch of stuff especially with so many academic lessons and task you have (depends on where you live in as different country has different education policy and curriculum) and this app will take care the mess so you can check what are the things must be done and get reminded of the upcoming task. In my country where i live in, sometimes most teacher skip the class which mean teaching learning process will be postpone, but this app will let you learn wherever you are using online teaching feature, no excuse for not studying!"
"Overall, I love the experience with Google Classroom. It enhances my ability to learn in and out of class ten-fold. If I were to ever become a teacher, I would definitely use Google Classroom as my way of communicating to my students."
"Overall, my experience has been very positive. It allows me and my students to stay organized. It holds students accountable for knowing what is expected of them and following up if they are absent. It also helps me stay organized as a leader with other teachers. It keeps all of our resources/activities organized nicely and we can access it anywhere anytime. "
"My overall experience with Google Classroom, I would say, has been more positive than negative. Although, the program does have some limitations, the positive aspects of this software outweigh their opposite counterparts. From its ease of use to its versatility, I would definitely rate this program as a beneficial one, that without a doubt has helped the organization of my academic career."
Since having to do all classes online due to the COVID-19 Pandemic I can honestly say that google classroom has saved the day! This has made life so much easier and it is an amazingly wonderful tool for educators and students alike! 
"I love this cloud-based paperless option for daily student work. Easy to share, collaborate and manage."
"My overall experience with Google Classroom has been great and compared to many of the other platforms that I have used in the past, I think this one is absolutely amazing. In terms of a clean interface with simplicity in being able to use, nothing beats Google Classroom! Therefore, I would highly reccomend for anyone looking to use this actually give it a try because it can be really convenient and make things easier!"
Overall I really like this program and would recommend it to teachers and tutors. It really makes our jobs easier. Not to mention since everything can be made and submitted online it is a lot better from the environment and cuts down way fewer trees. I got introduced to this software in High School and decided to use it for my part-time tutoring business ever since. Google Classroom is far superior to the other programs I have come across such as Moodle. I would say I give this program an 8/10.
"It's been extremely positive.  Teachers can upload a single document from google drive and decide whether they want students to each receive their own editable copy, how they want it turned in and how/if students can collaborate with each other. It's very easy to use.  "
Google Classroom is a great way for educators to assign work for students and share extra tools which would be helpful for students themselves. It reminds students when assignments are due and they can actively participate in discussions within the software itself.
#NAME?
"In my overall experience, Google Classroom is by a wide margin the best cloud-based conveyance framework I have ever utilized. Homeroom makes allotting notes, work and tests extremely simple. I especially appreciate the way that you can make a Google Form Quiz legitimately from the Classroom task button. Particularly noteworthy is the manner by which oneself stamping highlights in Google Forms can be straightforwardly brought into Google Classroom. Definitely I suggest all the educator to use it and implement the knowledge of technology for betterment of students. Google Classroom is one of the best ways for classroom management. Students  also love to study and get feedback through Google Classroom."
"I use Google Classroom every day to engage with the students in my classes. I put all information, handouts, and reading source on the platform, making it easy for the students to get them. I also use Google Classroom to set up assignment, making it easy for the students to upload their papers and easy for me to mark their works."
"No problems with it at all!  Works very well for schools! If the App ads more features that would be cool, but its great just the way it is! Very easy to use!"
I have had success using Google Classroom on a daily basis with my students both in school and during remote learning. Using Google Classroom has simplified sharing daily assignments with my students.
It allowed me to continue my studies and graduate in the midst of a serious political crisis.
I have realised that google classroom is a great software for both teachers and students because it makes their lives so much easier by making them be able to have a ''virtual classroom'' where they can keep track of all their assignments etc.
"I had a really good time using Google Classroom as a teacher and I would love to switch to it when possible. Google has always been known for its great Cloud-based service and productivity suites and this software is no different. If you're looking for a good LMS, this is it."
The benefits of Google Classroom is that it allows me to setup different classes and keep them all in one place.
"Overall, I am satisfied by product for basic courses, as a depository of curriculum, and a way for students to interact with each other and teacher."
I don't even remember what life was like before Google Classroom.  I use this resource so often to help keep my students informed of what's happening in the classroom.  This is one of the best tools to utilize to help students who are absent not fall behind when they miss school.  It's a fabulous resource that provides a wide range of uses for any classroom.
"I have been using Google Classroom more than some of my colleagues. And, during this unprecedented time of COVID-19 quarantine and distance learning, Google Classroom has been the saving grace of our school. All teachers in our building easily learned how to create classes and use it within less than 24 hours. Parents are loving having access to lessons online through Google Classroom. "
Google Classroom has been a very simple to use and low-cost (free!) solution for delivering my course content. It is easy to get students started and many of them are already familiar with the G Suite productivity tools so the barrier to interaction is quite low. 
Google classroom is a great digital resource when it comes to pushing out assignments to your students.  It is easy to use for a teacher and the students as well.  
"I can say Google Classroom is positive considering the overall benefits. Although the academic environment is not here, the technical advantages have inspired me and accelerated my work. Now is the age of technology. So distance learning activities directly through the Google Classroom is one of Google's best innovations. And the main advantage of this is that I can use it for free."
"Students can find absolutely everything they need in the Classroom. As long as they have an internet connection, they can access my Classroom from anywhere. Lost worksheets, forgotten instructions, reviews for tests, and much more are all at the ready. This has erased the need for repeated/redundant efforts on my part! This has saved so much time and frustration! Students are more successful because they have a backup resource at their fingertips. It also helps with parent involvement."
Connecting students and teachers is really good start by such Google product. I can hope that over the time Google people will be gradually adding awesome features in this product and they should keep space for another players also in their echo system.  I am overall happy with Google classroom
I have used Google Classroom as a teacher with students and also as an Instructional Technologist teaching teachers. It is still my favorite LMS option. 
"Overall, I really love using google classroom. It has made my teaching experience a lot easier than it was when I only used hard copies of every assignment and had to keep individual folders for each students work. "
"I used it as a teacher with my middle school students. I don't see it working for preschool or elementary, unless you add the parents as students as well. Parents need to create a Google account to be able to access the information from the newsletter/summary they get. Students don't really get a grade book, but they can see grades for each assignment. Needs a lot of work still. "

"Overall, I have found that this software has absolutely changed the way I teach.  I am able with the click of a button to send my students assignments, video links, study guides, and other resources essential for their learning.  It also makes it easier for parents to interact with their child's education and puts them in more of a position of power to help."
"My overall experience with Google Classroom has been extremely rewarding. I have saved so much time, paper, and energy which allows me to improve the quality of my assignments and teaching while I can interact with students in real time, monitor their work, and quickly see who has submitted work. I love that it is accessible on any device and it makes my job so much easier. I love that it has decreased paper wastage immensely and I would highly encourage teachers to utilize Google Classroom as it is certainly a game changer."
"Google Classroom is a must for any classroom with the technology to support it. Its easy implementation and connection to so many other tools, this will be a hub for your students and create an easy structure for your class - not to mention it is free AND a green solution!"
"Overall, I find Google classroom extremely user-friendly for all ages and levels of experience. It is very easy to upload assignments and documents. The fact that it is compatible with so many other websites makes it a huge plus in my book. If it would just add a few more customization tools, it would be the perfect platform to utilize within the classroom or through distance learning. "
"As a student, it's really hard to create better self management when it comes to managing the whole bunch of stuff especially with so many academic lessons and task you have (depends on where you live in as different country has different education policy and curriculum) and this app will take care the mess so you can check what are the things must be done and get reminded of the upcoming task. In my country where i live in, sometimes most teacher skip the class which mean teaching learning process will be postpone, but this app will let you learn wherever you are using online teaching feature, no excuse for not studying!"
"Overall, I love the experience with Google Classroom. It enhances my ability to learn in and out of class ten-fold. If I were to ever become a teacher, I would definitely use Google Classroom as my way of communicating to my students."
"Overall, my experience has been very positive. It allows me and my students to stay organized. It holds students accountable for knowing what is expected of them and following up if they are absent. It also helps me stay organized as a leader with other teachers. It keeps all of our resources/activities organized nicely and we can access it anywhere anytime. "
"My overall experience with Google Classroom, I would say, has been more positive than negative. Although, the program does have some limitations, the positive aspects of this software outweigh their opposite counterparts. From its ease of use to its versatility, I would definitely rate this program as a beneficial one, that without a doubt has helped the organization of my academic career."
Since having to do all classes online due to the COVID-19 Pandemic I can honestly say that google classroom has saved the day! This has made life so much easier and it is an amazingly wonderful tool for educators and students alike! 
"I love this cloud-based paperless option for daily student work. Easy to share, collaborate and manage."
"My overall experience with Google Classroom has been great and compared to many of the other platforms that I have used in the past, I think this one is absolutely amazing. In terms of a clean interface with simplicity in being able to use, nothing beats Google Classroom! Therefore, I would highly reccomend for anyone looking to use this actually give it a try because it can be really convenient and make things easier!"
Overall I really like this program and would recommend it to teachers and tutors. It really makes our jobs easier. Not to mention since everything can be made and submitted online it is a lot better from the environment and cuts down way fewer trees. I got introduced to this software in High School and decided to use it for my part-time tutoring business ever since. Google Classroom is far superior to the other programs I have come across such as Moodle. I would say I give this program an 8/10.
"It's been extremely positive.  Teachers can upload a single document from google drive and decide whether they want students to each receive their own editable copy, how they want it turned in and how/if students can collaborate with each other. It's very easy to use.  "
Google Classroom is a great way for educators to assign work for students and share extra tools which would be helpful for students themselves. It reminds students when assignments are due and they can actively participate in discussions within the software itself.

"In my overall experience, Google Classroom is by a wide margin the best cloud-based conveyance framework I have ever utilized. Homeroom makes allotting notes, work and tests extremely simple. I especially appreciate the way that you can make a Google Form Quiz legitimately from the Classroom task button. Particularly noteworthy is the manner by which oneself stamping highlights in Google Forms can be straightforwardly brought into Google Classroom. Definitely I suggest all the educator to use it and implement the knowledge of technology for betterment of students. Google Classroom is one of the best ways for classroom management. Students  also love to study and get feedback through Google Classroom."
"I use Google Classroom every day to engage with the students in my classes. I put all information, handouts, and reading source on the platform, making it easy for the students to get them. I also use Google Classroom to set up assignment, making it easy for the students to upload their papers and easy for me to mark their works."
"No problems with it at all!  Works very well for schools! If the App ads more features that would be cool, but its great just the way it is! Very easy to use!"
I have had success using Google Classroom on a daily basis with my students both in school and during remote learning. Using Google Classroom has simplified sharing daily assignments with my students.
It allowed me to continue my studies and graduate in the midst of a serious political crisis.
I have realised that google classroom is a great software for both teachers and students because it makes their lives so much easier by making them be able to have a ''virtual classroom'' where they can keep track of all their assignments etc.
"I had a really good time using Google Classroom as a teacher and I would love to switch to it when possible. Google has always been known for its great Cloud-based service and productivity suites and this software is no different. If you're looking for a good LMS, this is it."
The benefits of Google Classroom is that it allows me to setup different classes and keep them all in one place.
"Overall, I am satisfied by product for basic courses, as a depository of curriculum, and a way for students to interact with each other and teacher."
I don't even remember what life was like before Google Classroom.  I use this resource so often to help keep my students informed of what's happening in the classroom.  This is one of the best tools to utilize to help students who are absent not fall behind when they miss school.  It's a fabulous resource that provides a wide range of uses for any classroom.
"I have been using Google Classroom more than some of my colleagues. And, during this unprecedented time of COVID-19 quarantine and distance learning, Google Classroom has been the saving grace of our school. All teachers in our building easily learned how to create classes and use it within less than 24 hours. Parents are loving having access to lessons online through Google Classroom. "
Google Classroom has been a very simple to use and low-cost (free!) solution for delivering my course content. It is easy to get students started and many of them are already familiar with the G Suite productivity tools so the barrier to interaction is quite low. 
Google classroom is a great digital resource when it comes to pushing out assignments to your students.  It is easy to use for a teacher and the students as well.  
"I can say Google Classroom is positive considering the overall benefits. Although the academic environment is not here, the technical advantages have inspired me and accelerated my work. Now is the age of technology. So distance learning activities directly through the Google Classroom is one of Google's best innovations. And the main advantage of this is that I can use it for free."
"Students can find absolutely everything they need in the Classroom. As long as they have an internet connection, they can access my Classroom from anywhere. Lost worksheets, forgotten instructions, reviews for tests, and much more are all at the ready. This has erased the need for repeated/redundant efforts on my part! This has saved so much time and frustration! Students are more successful because they have a backup resource at their fingertips. It also helps with parent involvement."
Connecting students and teachers is really good start by such Google product. I can hope that over the time Google people will be gradually adding awesome features in this product and they should keep space for another players also in their echo system.  I am overall happy with Google classroom
I have used Google Classroom as a teacher with students and also as an Instructional Technologist teaching teachers. It is still my favorite LMS option. 
"Overall, I really love using google classroom. It has made my teaching experience a lot easier than it was when I only used hard copies of every assignment and had to keep individual folders for each students work. "
"I used it as a teacher with my middle school students. I don't see it working for preschool or elementary, unless you add the parents as students as well. Parents need to create a Google account to be able to access the information from the newsletter/summary they get. Students don't really get a grade book, but they can see grades for each assignment. Needs a lot of work still. "
"Teachers loved how easy it was to use, and how it links up. Parents also thought it was easier to use as well which is a plus. "
"It has been a very positive experience despite the glitches. Every year, Google improves Google Classroom. "
"I've used this software for long and it's very good. I've used it often in school. Very easy to use, and you just need a google account to log in. Awesome and I can really recommend it! 7/10"
Our overall experience with Google classroom is favorable.  We have used it in conjunction with our 1:1 technology initiative with student issued Chromebooks.  We have no plans to switch products at this time
"I really enjoy using Google Classroom to get information out to my students quickly.  It is my Homebase for all of my websites, information, assessments, files, you name it.  My students know to go there for links to everything."
"Overall, Google classroom works nicely as a supplemental classroom tool for digital work. It gets the job done even if it lacks a few small features. I plan to continue using it whether those features are added or not due to the ease of setup and management for teachers and students. "
I've realized that this is a great way to group students and evaluate them.
AMAZING. Very user friendly/ kid friendly. Very aesthetically pleasing and not overwhelming! 
"It's user friendly, FREE, and I had no problems with it whatsoever. "
Google Classroom was very useful to me as a college student that depends on out of class work and studying. So this app was overall amazing.
"Google Classroom has become an essential part of my graduation. The ease and speed with which teachers can post assignments, reading materials and classes, in addition to the interaction between students and teachers, make Google Classroom a great ally of our studies, and its relevance is even more evident in these times of social detachment and quarantine."
"My overall experience has been very positive.  It's made facilitating classes much easier, and has allowed students to do more work when it's the best timing for them.  In our specialized school we deal with a lot of absenteeism, and Classroom helps to manage that issue much better than what I was using before."
Google Classroom is a wonderful way to distribute writing assignments to my whole class and comes complete with spell check to make the editing process all the easier for my learning writers. I express particular gratitude for the speech-to-text feature that I know I will be using for a long time to come.

"I use a variety of collaboration tools, but my regular go-to tool is meet.google.com. Also, since Google upgraded Hangouts to add a phone number option, it's become a possible to use with everyone, regardless of someone's firewall settings."
"Overall I loved using google hangouts! It's clean, fast, responsive, good quality video and audio calls and my students love it. Seeing both email and chat's also in Gmail has also been a cool feature just another part of the synchronicity. A great product that is available for free and a product that should be used by everyone."
"Using Google Hangouts Meet software I am able to stay connected with my employees and my business partner when working remotely. So, my website content, products inventory and customer complaints continue to be addressed while I am not physically present in my brick and mortar apparel store. The best part is the fact that I don't have to pay a subscription fees or maintenance fees. Hence, my ROI is high. If I face any issues with the software, I am able to find plenty of support in Google portal and other blogs. "
"My usage of it is to simply connect with the client, conduct a consult with a potential client. It accomplishes those tasks for me easily. "
"Every app which is connected to google is distinguished with it's UI/UX, it is comfortable for using and easier to explain to other people how to use it. You can make a call for large group of people and experience will just get better and better."
"Good video conferencing tool that allows you to connect with relative ease to others with Google accounts simply and fast. Wish it still had options to share files etc or share screen. A little bit too basic for my liking, especially when you are already connected to the suite."
Since I tend to use a lot of google products it made sense to use Google hangouts for chats. I also wanted a way to receive and send text messages from my computer if I wasn't using a mac's imessage. 
"Reliable calls, great quality video & audio, and the built in chat + presentation options are great."
Amazing quality with such an ease to connect friends and family.
"I've made a few tries with this software and still trying it out, and testing its pros and cons. "
"Google Meet has become a daily tool in my life since the adoption of distance learning at my university. It is very easy and quick to get used to it, but some technical problems can make your experience less fluid and a little irritating at times. Overall, it is a reliable, competent program, but it can improve in some aspects."
"Overall, this app is useful. That's why I use it daily.  I have a Google Pixel 2, so it's easy to use Google apps."
Overall love Hangouts. 
Basically what we were looking for was a conferencing solution that was free and reliable. Working and presentations directly from home was also a big consideration. Hangouts successfully filled that space and has presented  no reason to switch
"I love this software! I really do. I use it as the team chat in my organization. For simple communications and messages this is my to-go software. It's instantaneous, and since it's an extension from Google, the messages can be received either through the computer or the cellphone. In addition, the video conferencing and share screen options are awesome! It's been proved to be very helpful to me when I want to discuss about something with somebody who is not physically present. I use this software for work only to avoid confusions with personal communications. "
"I've used Google Hangouts predecessor, Google Voice, since it came out. I even used it with Sprint when they partnered automatic voice forwarding and using your Sprint number on Google Voice (circa ~2010). Back then, I'd often use my HP laptop's microphone array and speakers covering the width of the device to use the speakerphone. Better quality on my laptop speakerphone setup with Google Voice (later Hangouts) than directly on a phone. Google Hangout's voice quality has always been exceptionally clear and steady. No perceptible delays, no stuttering, and it sounds high bitrate.  Google Hangouts continues to provide cheap international phone calls through any of their interfaces. Also, enabled me to call over any Wi-Fi enabled device for cheaper calling when traveling outside USA.  I often use a bluetooth headset with my computer, alternate regularly between Android + iOS devices (often carrying two simultaneously), while always maintaining Google Hangouts in the background and the same number across all devices. In recent years, Google Hangouts allowed me to login to multiple phone accounts in a single device.  In addition to voice, Google Hangouts in recent years began supporting text and media messages through their desktop and mobile app making it seamless to start a conversation on one device then move to a more efficient device without waiting for a synchronization. Its become a complete cell phone replacement without the need to stay connected to one wireless carrier."
"Very satisfied! This allows me to stay up to date with colleagues and stay on the same page regarding projects and tasks. We tried other platforms, but given Hangouts integration with G Suite, this is hands down the best option."
"Super happy with this product, glad to have made the switch and have no intention of switching to anything else anytime. (Though I do wish I could record meetings...)"
Overall Google Hangouts provides us with good chatting functionality within our institute. End users find it extremely easy to use and enjoy seeing their email and chats in the same window.
Over 2 years I have been using google hangouts and my experience was very positive. It's one of the most famous and incredible applications available for communication. Application is very light and it loads really fast. For me it's a great tool for video conferencing and collaboration. I think it is a good invesment for any business.
"I am using Google Hangout tool at work to conduct conferencing calls with web developers so I can explain tagging requirements and strategy for new web pages, sites or applications. I also use it to do vendor presentations on how a particular media campaign performed. Overall my experience has been smooth as long as I am running one conferencing session and have closed all previous sessions. If I am calling using the random conference number and have muted the Hangout session while sharing my screen, it works fine. "
I love Google Hangouts! It's how my team connects on a daily basis and is so easy to access and utilize. It's super user friendly and very streamlined.
"conversations on google hangout cannot be deleted or edited, that makes it to serve has a good record keeping platform for my organisation, in case i forget my past conversation i can search them out. Hangout has helped my organisation to save cost sourcing for other messaging platforms and i prefer it for instant messaging."
We have been able to use Google Hangouts to quickly and easily communicate across departments and locations for simple and easy exchange of information.
"I use Hangouts to contact potential clients. I like not having to share my phone number from good to first, I think it's important to keep my personal data protected. I prefer that my clients contact me by email or social networks before sharing my phone number. I also made videoconferences in which the shared screen is one of the tools I use the most. Although it seems incredible, I really like that Hangouts does not notify if the other person saw or did not see the messages, because I think it's an unnecessary functionality. Today we can see a message and not respond immediately because we are busy and for no other reason. But sometimes it's misinterpreted. This is one of the reasons why I like hangouts more than other messaging platforms."
"Google Hangouts helped me and continues to help me with my business to connect with my clients and colleagues, although it has many things that can be improved, it has everything necessary to communicate in addition, free of charge, unlimited and without the need to use other applications, much less install anything . It is a very good solution especially if you are a user of the entire Google ecosystem since, as expected, its integration is excellent."
Without Google Hangouts I wouldn't have been able to successfully complete my tasks and responsibilities while working from home remotely. I highly recommend this tool for small companies that want to allow their employees the ability to telecommute.
"Hangout has helped my organization reduce spending on a previous collaboration software we hitherto used. I personally prefer hangout for my instant messaging activities. Not only is the software smooth and lightweight, but it is also very easy to use as well as been quick and unproblematic. It is the epitome of messaging convenience for me."
"Our company has a very flexible work-from-home policy, which means that most of our meetings occur with someone joining via Hangouts. It's usually a very good experience, we share screen and work very much like we were sitting side by side. It's especially useful for working on a shared Google document, both reading and editing at the same time. We also use it with clients, who are increasingly adopting Google suite as their corporative tool for emails and documents. We've grown so used to this way of remote collaborations that we cringe when asked to use Skype and get office documents attached to emails.   I would definitely recommend Hangouts as a great tool for video meeting and collaboration, however I cannot vouch for it's performance with large quantity of attendants, we usually have no more than two or three people connecting remotely to Hangouts.  "
"Hangouts definitely has a lot of potential and the fact it can be downloaded on your phone is amazing because a lot of people have issues sending texts between Apple and Android devices. Perhaps, instead of having the hangouts extension open up a mini tab for hangouts, have it take you to the old official site instead? I liked the old site a lot better than the extension window that pops up. Overall, Hangouts is a great communications tool and should be used more than it is by the common person. Highly underrated. "
"Integration is the key selling point for using Hangouts. I like that I can access it from anywhere, can talk to people seamlessly through multiple devices, and have search features at my disposal. Having the option to video chat and send multi-media messages is also nice (yay GIFs!). I have definitely told people they need to use it, especially if they have a gmail address. Overall, the good outweighs the bad and I think the bad is sure to be fixed."
"Google knows best. So it's killing* (arguably) a good service. I like Hangouts. I use it every day many times a day.  My work messages come through hangouts. My personal messages come through hangsouts. They are on my phone, my tablet, my car, my computer. They are with me. Text? When my phone service is spotty, I don't get texts..... but I might have wifi. And my wifi get's hangouts!  So, it's great, and it's going away in 2019(ish)"
"Hangouts gives a fast and efficient communication setup for its users, allowing them to contact clients, coworkers, and friends easily and efficiently, with very few drawbacks. It is one of my primary communication tools with coworkers, and I will probably keep using it as such for long into the future."
"The truth is that I have used many instant messaging tools, and this in particular is my favorite. I think it is very flexible and very well thought out for corporate environments where they can all be communicated in addition to the google suite.  My experience with this multiplatform solution has been very good, particularly my agenda is always full of meetings and in most of the time I have some document to present, and what gives me more value is that you can archive the conversations and calls to keep them synchronized on the cloud.  I recommend it to all users who wish to have communication under a platform that innovates every day."
"An efficient software, easy to use, with a very nice and effective interface. These are the ideas that come to mind at the time of qualifying this incredible software that has facilitated in a considerable way my labor and professional development. "
Hangouts for me is essential in day to day
"It keeps me in touch with anybody, anywhere, running just as well on iOS as it does on Android and in the web browser. If I need to access information that was previously discussed, I can review and search through conversations dating back nearly a decade."
"While Hangouts was groundbreaking software, its impending discontinuation makes it hard to recommend."
It's an amazing tool that meets the needs of organization and individuals by securing the messages sent through an end to end encryption to secure privacy.
as i said its have a lot of features should be add in next generation of the app i liked so much if its add notifications on that 
I found it one of the easier ways to make free wifi calls at the begining of the wifi calling era.   They haven't adjusted with the times. I had hoped that Hangouts had been more secure for the users not just gathering data for the Google Machine.  Which is already run by AI....just kidding. I have to be right...
Overall I have had a very positive experience using Hangouts. It's wonderful as an individual and works perfectly for my business as well. I need to be able to have private chats with clients and this makes it easy to stay connected without providing my personal phone number.
"Currently we use this tool in my company through a multiple conversation of 28 participants across the country, in which we all put monitoring information at the moment of the news events that occur in each city.  All this information is analyzed and reports prepared for the managers and executives of the organization. "
"Hangouts is an excellent software, because it is much easier to use than other software that provide the same service, as it has many interesting options that can be complemented with communications between two or more people.   I recommend this software to all those who require a good tool to communicate between two or more people. "
"It makes meeting easier. Especially when it comes to vendor partners that are out of state, it makes it easy to connect face-to-face instead of on a call. Additionally audio is sooooo much crisper. I don't have the issues I typically do on phone calls saying ""Hey, I missed that. Can you repeat yourself?"" over and over and over again."
"Overall, Hangouts was the program for us. Rival video chat and stream software used too much bandwidth or lacked the quality that Hangouts produced. "
We have been using Google Hangouts to have online meetings with members that are all over Australia and NZ. This has been an excellent tool to have meetings and keep the socialness on point. I think it is better to see the people you are speaking to than just listen to their voices. I will keep using this for work and for personal use. 
"I use a variety of collaboration tools, but my regular go-to tool is meet.google.com. Also, since Google upgraded Hangouts to add a phone number option, it's become a possible to use with everyone, regardless of someone's firewall settings."
"Overall I loved using google hangouts! It's clean, fast, responsive, good quality video and audio calls and my students love it. Seeing both email and chat's also in Gmail has also been a cool feature just another part of the synchronicity. A great product that is available for free and a product that should be used by everyone."
"Using Google Hangouts Meet software I am able to stay connected with my employees and my business partner when working remotely. So, my website content, products inventory and customer complaints continue to be addressed while I am not physically present in my brick and mortar apparel store. The best part is the fact that I don't have to pay a subscription fees or maintenance fees. Hence, my ROI is high. If I face any issues with the software, I am able to find plenty of support in Google portal and other blogs. "
"My usage of it is to simply connect with the client, conduct a consult with a potential client. It accomplishes those tasks for me easily. "
"Every app which is connected to google is distinguished with it's UI/UX, it is comfortable for using and easier to explain to other people how to use it. You can make a call for large group of people and experience will just get better and better."
"Good video conferencing tool that allows you to connect with relative ease to others with Google accounts simply and fast. Wish it still had options to share files etc or share screen. A little bit too basic for my liking, especially when you are already connected to the suite."
Since I tend to use a lot of google products it made sense to use Google hangouts for chats. I also wanted a way to receive and send text messages from my computer if I wasn't using a mac's imessage. 
"Reliable calls, great quality video & audio, and the built in chat + presentation options are great."
Amazing quality with such an ease to connect friends and family.
"I've made a few tries with this software and still trying it out, and testing its pros and cons. "
"Google Meet has become a daily tool in my life since the adoption of distance learning at my university. It is very easy and quick to get used to it, but some technical problems can make your experience less fluid and a little irritating at times. Overall, it is a reliable, competent program, but it can improve in some aspects."
"Overall, this app is useful. That's why I use it daily.  I have a Google Pixel 2, so it's easy to use Google apps."
Overall love Hangouts. 
Basically what we were looking for was a conferencing solution that was free and reliable. Working and presentations directly from home was also a big consideration. Hangouts successfully filled that space and has presented  no reason to switch
"I love this software! I really do. I use it as the team chat in my organization. For simple communications and messages this is my to-go software. It's instantaneous, and since it's an extension from Google, the messages can be received either through the computer or the cellphone. In addition, the video conferencing and share screen options are awesome! It's been proved to be very helpful to me when I want to discuss about something with somebody who is not physically present. I use this software for work only to avoid confusions with personal communications. "
"I've used Google Hangouts predecessor, Google Voice, since it came out. I even used it with Sprint when they partnered automatic voice forwarding and using your Sprint number on Google Voice (circa ~2010). Back then, I'd often use my HP laptop's microphone array and speakers covering the width of the device to use the speakerphone. Better quality on my laptop speakerphone setup with Google Voice (later Hangouts) than directly on a phone. Google Hangout's voice quality has always been exceptionally clear and steady. No perceptible delays, no stuttering, and it sounds high bitrate.  Google Hangouts continues to provide cheap international phone calls through any of their interfaces. Also, enabled me to call over any Wi-Fi enabled device for cheaper calling when traveling outside USA.  I often use a bluetooth headset with my computer, alternate regularly between Android + iOS devices (often carrying two simultaneously), while always maintaining Google Hangouts in the background and the same number across all devices. In recent years, Google Hangouts allowed me to login to multiple phone accounts in a single device.  In addition to voice, Google Hangouts in recent years began supporting text and media messages through their desktop and mobile app making it seamless to start a conversation on one device then move to a more efficient device without waiting for a synchronization. Its become a complete cell phone replacement without the need to stay connected to one wireless carrier."
"Very satisfied! This allows me to stay up to date with colleagues and stay on the same page regarding projects and tasks. We tried other platforms, but given Hangouts integration with G Suite, this is hands down the best option."
"Super happy with this product, glad to have made the switch and have no intention of switching to anything else anytime. (Though I do wish I could record meetings...)"
Overall Google Hangouts provides us with good chatting functionality within our institute. End users find it extremely easy to use and enjoy seeing their email and chats in the same window.
Over 2 years I have been using google hangouts and my experience was very positive. It's one of the most famous and incredible applications available for communication. Application is very light and it loads really fast. For me it's a great tool for video conferencing and collaboration. I think it is a good invesment for any business.
"I am using Google Hangout tool at work to conduct conferencing calls with web developers so I can explain tagging requirements and strategy for new web pages, sites or applications. I also use it to do vendor presentations on how a particular media campaign performed. Overall my experience has been smooth as long as I am running one conferencing session and have closed all previous sessions. If I am calling using the random conference number and have muted the Hangout session while sharing my screen, it works fine. "
I love Google Hangouts! It's how my team connects on a daily basis and is so easy to access and utilize. It's super user friendly and very streamlined.
"conversations on google hangout cannot be deleted or edited, that makes it to serve has a good record keeping platform for my organisation, in case i forget my past conversation i can search them out. Hangout has helped my organisation to save cost sourcing for other messaging platforms and i prefer it for instant messaging."
We have been able to use Google Hangouts to quickly and easily communicate across departments and locations for simple and easy exchange of information.
"I use Hangouts to contact potential clients. I like not having to share my phone number from good to first, I think it's important to keep my personal data protected. I prefer that my clients contact me by email or social networks before sharing my phone number. I also made videoconferences in which the shared screen is one of the tools I use the most. Although it seems incredible, I really like that Hangouts does not notify if the other person saw or did not see the messages, because I think it's an unnecessary functionality. Today we can see a message and not respond immediately because we are busy and for no other reason. But sometimes it's misinterpreted. This is one of the reasons why I like hangouts more than other messaging platforms."
"Google Hangouts helped me and continues to help me with my business to connect with my clients and colleagues, although it has many things that can be improved, it has everything necessary to communicate in addition, free of charge, unlimited and without the need to use other applications, much less install anything . It is a very good solution especially if you are a user of the entire Google ecosystem since, as expected, its integration is excellent."
Without Google Hangouts I wouldn't have been able to successfully complete my tasks and responsibilities while working from home remotely. I highly recommend this tool for small companies that want to allow their employees the ability to telecommute.
"Hangout has helped my organization reduce spending on a previous collaboration software we hitherto used. I personally prefer hangout for my instant messaging activities. Not only is the software smooth and lightweight, but it is also very easy to use as well as been quick and unproblematic. It is the epitome of messaging convenience for me."
"Our company has a very flexible work-from-home policy, which means that most of our meetings occur with someone joining via Hangouts. It's usually a very good experience, we share screen and work very much like we were sitting side by side. It's especially useful for working on a shared Google document, both reading and editing at the same time. We also use it with clients, who are increasingly adopting Google suite as their corporative tool for emails and documents. We've grown so used to this way of remote collaborations that we cringe when asked to use Skype and get office documents attached to emails.   I would definitely recommend Hangouts as a great tool for video meeting and collaboration, however I cannot vouch for it's performance with large quantity of attendants, we usually have no more than two or three people connecting remotely to Hangouts.  "
"Hangouts definitely has a lot of potential and the fact it can be downloaded on your phone is amazing because a lot of people have issues sending texts between Apple and Android devices. Perhaps, instead of having the hangouts extension open up a mini tab for hangouts, have it take you to the old official site instead? I liked the old site a lot better than the extension window that pops up. Overall, Hangouts is a great communications tool and should be used more than it is by the common person. Highly underrated. "
"Integration is the key selling point for using Hangouts. I like that I can access it from anywhere, can talk to people seamlessly through multiple devices, and have search features at my disposal. Having the option to video chat and send multi-media messages is also nice (yay GIFs!). I have definitely told people they need to use it, especially if they have a gmail address. Overall, the good outweighs the bad and I think the bad is sure to be fixed."
"Google knows best. So it's killing* (arguably) a good service. I like Hangouts. I use it every day many times a day.  My work messages come through hangouts. My personal messages come through hangsouts. They are on my phone, my tablet, my car, my computer. They are with me. Text? When my phone service is spotty, I don't get texts..... but I might have wifi. And my wifi get's hangouts!  So, it's great, and it's going away in 2019(ish)"
"Hangouts gives a fast and efficient communication setup for its users, allowing them to contact clients, coworkers, and friends easily and efficiently, with very few drawbacks. It is one of my primary communication tools with coworkers, and I will probably keep using it as such for long into the future."
"The truth is that I have used many instant messaging tools, and this in particular is my favorite. I think it is very flexible and very well thought out for corporate environments where they can all be communicated in addition to the google suite.  My experience with this multiplatform solution has been very good, particularly my agenda is always full of meetings and in most of the time I have some document to present, and what gives me more value is that you can archive the conversations and calls to keep them synchronized on the cloud.  I recommend it to all users who wish to have communication under a platform that innovates every day."
"An efficient software, easy to use, with a very nice and effective interface. These are the ideas that come to mind at the time of qualifying this incredible software that has facilitated in a considerable way my labor and professional development. "
Hangouts for me is essential in day to day
"It keeps me in touch with anybody, anywhere, running just as well on iOS as it does on Android and in the web browser. If I need to access information that was previously discussed, I can review and search through conversations dating back nearly a decade."
"While Hangouts was groundbreaking software, its impending discontinuation makes it hard to recommend."
It's an amazing tool that meets the needs of organization and individuals by securing the messages sent through an end to end encryption to secure privacy.
as i said its have a lot of features should be add in next generation of the app i liked so much if its add notifications on that 
I found it one of the easier ways to make free wifi calls at the begining of the wifi calling era.   They haven't adjusted with the times. I had hoped that Hangouts had been more secure for the users not just gathering data for the Google Machine.  Which is already run by AI....just kidding. I have to be right...
Overall I have had a very positive experience using Hangouts. It's wonderful as an individual and works perfectly for my business as well. I need to be able to have private chats with clients and this makes it easy to stay connected without providing my personal phone number.
"Currently we use this tool in my company through a multiple conversation of 28 participants across the country, in which we all put monitoring information at the moment of the news events that occur in each city.

Overall Google Hangouts provides us with good chatting functionality within our institute. End users find it extremely easy to use and enjoy seeing their email and chats in the same window.
Over 2 years I have been using google hangouts and my experience was very positive. It's one of the most famous and incredible applications available for communication. Application is very light and it loads really fast. For me it's a great tool for video conferencing and collaboration. I think it is a good invesment for any business.
"I am using Google Hangout tool at work to conduct conferencing calls with web developers so I can explain tagging requirements and strategy for new web pages, sites or applications. I also use it to do vendor presentations on how a particular media campaign performed. Overall my experience has been smooth as long as I am running one conferencing session and have closed all previous sessions. If I am calling using the random conference number and have muted the Hangout session while sharing my screen, it works fine. "
I love Google Hangouts! It's how my team connects on a daily basis and is so easy to access and utilize. It's super user friendly and very streamlined.
"conversations on google hangout cannot be deleted or edited, that makes it to serve has a good record keeping platform for my organisation, in case i forget my past conversation i can search them out. Hangout has helped my organisation to save cost sourcing for other messaging platforms and i prefer it for instant messaging."
We have been able to use Google Hangouts to quickly and easily communicate across departments and locations for simple and easy exchange of information.
"I use Hangouts to contact potential clients. I like not having to share my phone number from good to first, I think it's important to keep my personal data protected. I prefer that my clients contact me by email or social networks before sharing my phone number. I also made videoconferences in which the shared screen is one of the tools I use the most. Although it seems incredible, I really like that Hangouts does not notify if the other person saw or did not see the messages, because I think it's an unnecessary functionality. Today we can see a message and not respond immediately because we are busy and for no other reason. But sometimes it's misinterpreted. This is one of the reasons why I like hangouts more than other messaging platforms."
"Google Hangouts helped me and continues to help me with my business to connect with my clients and colleagues, although it has many things that can be improved, it has everything necessary to communicate in addition, free of charge, unlimited and without the need to use other applications, much less install anything . It is a very good solution especially if you are a user of the entire Google ecosystem since, as expected, its integration is excellent."
Without Google Hangouts I wouldn't have been able to successfully complete my tasks and responsibilities while working from home remotely. I highly recommend this tool for small companies that want to allow their employees the ability to telecommute.
"Hangout has helped my organization reduce spending on a previous collaboration software we hitherto used. I personally prefer hangout for my instant messaging activities. Not only is the software smooth and lightweight, but it is also very easy to use as well as been quick and unproblematic. It is the epitome of messaging convenience for me."
"Our company has a very flexible work-from-home policy, which means that most of our meetings occur with someone joining via Hangouts. It's usually a very good experience, we share screen and work very much like we were sitting side by side. It's especially useful for working on a shared Google document, both reading and editing at the same time. We also use it with clients, who are increasingly adopting Google suite as their corporative tool for emails and documents. We've grown so used to this way of remote collaborations that we cringe when asked to use Skype and get office documents attached to emails.   I would definitely recommend Hangouts as a great tool for video meeting and collaboration, however I cannot vouch for it's performance with large quantity of attendants, we usually have no more than two or three people connecting remotely to Hangouts.  "
"Hangouts definitely has a lot of potential and the fact it can be downloaded on your phone is amazing because a lot of people have issues sending texts between Apple and Android devices. Perhaps, instead of having the hangouts extension open up a mini tab for hangouts, have it take you to the old official site instead? I liked the old site a lot better than the extension window that pops up. Overall, Hangouts is a great communications tool and should be used more than it is by the common person. Highly underrated. "
"Integration is the key selling point for using Hangouts. I like that I can access it from anywhere, can talk to people seamlessly through multiple devices, and have search features at my disposal. Having the option to video chat and send multi-media messages is also nice (yay GIFs!). I have definitely told people they need to use it, especially if they have a gmail address. Overall, the good outweighs the bad and I think the bad is sure to be fixed."
"Google knows best. So it's killing* (arguably) a good service. I like Hangouts. I use it every day many times a day.  My work messages come through hangouts. My personal messages come through hangsouts. They are on my phone, my tablet, my car, my computer. They are with me. Text? When my phone service is spotty, I don't get texts..... but I might have wifi. And my wifi get's hangouts!  So, it's great, and it's going away in 2019(ish)"
"Hangouts gives a fast and efficient communication setup for its users, allowing them to contact clients, coworkers, and friends easily and efficiently, with very few drawbacks. It is one of my primary communication tools with coworkers, and I will probably keep using it as such for long into the future."
"The truth is that I have used many instant messaging tools, and this in particular is my favorite. I think it is very flexible and very well thought out for corporate environments where they can all be communicated in addition to the google suite.  My experience with this multiplatform solution has been very good, particularly my agenda is always full of meetings and in most of the time I have some document to present, and what gives me more value is that you can archive the conversations and calls to keep them synchronized on the cloud.  I recommend it to all users who wish to have communication under a platform that innovates every day."
"An efficient software, easy to use, with a very nice and effective interface. These are the ideas that come to mind at the time of qualifying this incredible software that has facilitated in a considerable way my labor and professional development. "
Hangouts for me is essential in day to day
"It keeps me in touch with anybody, anywhere, running just as well on iOS as it does on Android and in the web browser. If I need to access information that was previously discussed, I can review and search through conversations dating back nearly a decade."
"While Hangouts was groundbreaking software, its impending discontinuation makes it hard to recommend."
It's an amazing tool that meets the needs of organization and individuals by securing the messages sent through an end to end encryption to secure privacy.
as i said its have a lot of features should be add in next generation of the app i liked so much if its add notifications on that 
I found it one of the easier ways to make free wifi calls at the begining of the wifi calling era.   They haven't adjusted with the times. I had hoped that Hangouts had been more secure for the users not just gathering data for the Google Machine.  Which is already run by AI....just kidding. I have to be right...
Overall I have had a very positive experience using Hangouts. It's wonderful as an individual and works perfectly for my business as well. I need to be able to have private chats with clients and this makes it easy to stay connected without providing my personal phone number.
"Currently we use this tool in my company through a multiple conversation of 28 participants across the country, in which we all put monitoring information at the moment of the news events that occur in each city.  All this information is analyzed and reports prepared for the managers and executives of the organization. "
"Hangouts is an excellent software, because it is much easier to use than other software that provide the same service, as it has many interesting options that can be complemented with communications between two or more people.   I recommend this software to all those who require a good tool to communicate between two or more people. "
"It makes meeting easier. Especially when it comes to vendor partners that are out of state, it makes it easy to connect face-to-face instead of on a call. Additionally audio is sooooo much crisper. I don't have the issues I typically do on phone calls saying ""Hey, I missed that. Can you repeat yourself?"" over and over and over again."
"Overall, Hangouts was the program for us. Rival video chat and stream software used too much bandwidth or lacked the quality that Hangouts produced. "
We have been using Google Hangouts to have online meetings with members that are all over Australia and NZ. This has been an excellent tool to have meetings and keep the socialness on point. I think it is better to see the people you are speaking to than just listen to their voices. I will keep using this for work and for personal use. 
"I have offices, customers, account managers, partners and even developers in severalc countries. With this solution I can keep meetings or presentations everywhere in the World where I have Internet connection. The sound can be by Internet or phone call, I can share my screen ot my webcam, and aldo I can save the meeting, to keep track of it."
"GoToMeeting is an effective platform for most business needs. Just be sure that you do not require any unique support needs, or if you do that you have the time to wait and deal with the technician tango that companies like this do."
"This software works. The mobile apps run great and won't dissapoint. The addins to install on PC and Mac are lighweight and install very quickly and it still leads when connecting to different IT environments (we have never experienced having issues with a customer when using GoTo Meeting in their network), something that some remote meeting softwares haven't been able to achieve."
Very useful for conducting the live meetings with the screen sharing! 
GoTo is very integral to my work since I oversee a number of software projects and I need to ensure the stakeholders and colleagues are roped in quickly to address issues that may arise.  I enjoy the ease of use.  I just hope they stabilize audio connectivity.
GotoMeeting has been the premier corporate web chat service for a long time. They have decent customer support and respond to you within a day or so. Not bad at all. 
"I had daily meeting with my teams in latin america. Either scheduled or on  the rush, GTM never failed as the preferred tool among the C suite"
We have relished a lot from time saving to keeping social distancing while undertaking conferences. 
I was able to connect with more those that didn't know how to video/audio conference from their computers and needed to use a conference bridge phone number.
"We use slack for most of our intracompany communication, but GoToMeeting is what we use for all voice or video telecons with external parties."
"Overall this is an indispensable tool for me despite the bugs that might pop up, or because it makes it easier to conference with team members who are not able to be present at my meetings. It is also very helpful to attend a meeting when I am not able to attend in person, such as when I am sick but can not afford to miss out on a critical meeting. "
"Overall it does exactly what I need it to do, but I’m really comparing it to WebEx. With WebEx, I could record meetings, create meetings through Outlook, and it had SSO enabled. GoToMeeting seems like a step backwards, but it still gets the job done. Just a little more tedious in my opinion."
"The overall experience is really good; GTM runs flawlessly every time and it is full of options. The main con is just related to its price. However if you or your company can afford it, it is a really good option as a meeting software."
"In general I've a really good experience with GTM, the video/audio quality is remarkable, and the usability is excelent. In my humble opinion, is one of the best meeting software I've ever used."
"I love using GoToMeeting for my team meetings. It's reliable and easy to use. We have tested out other meeting solutions including Zoom, but none compare to the ease of use found with GTM. Zoom meetings, for instance, have a much different interface, and very little is intuitive about the dashboard. Conversely, GoToMeeting's dashboard is easy to understand and follow. You can also easily change your user name within a meeting, so if you are on an informal meeting with team members you might just list your first name, whereas for a client meeting you can list your full name, title, etc."
"Being able to communicate with other people in my company and the ability to have it recorded, with being able to go back and see who said what and who was suppose to do what.  Just the time of not needing to take notes is wonderful. Now I just print them out and highlight the important stuff.  GoToMeetings has made my business look larger than it is when I speak with very large companies. When I set up a GoToMeeting with them they are very impressed. It also gives me the opportunity to demonstrate our products. It's so much better than having them go to YouTube to watch a video. At GoToMeeting I demonstrate and then they can ask questions there ""real time."" If they want me to change a parameter, I can do that, right then, ""real time.""  So my experience over all is wonderful."
I use this software almost on a daily basis to communicate with team members that are not situated in the same geographical location. It is the company wide go to software for all and it does make connecting with virtual teams much simpler. I think there is something for everyone in this software and it will only get better with time.
"I love GoToMeeting (GTM)! I teach online and hold live chats sometimes 3 nights a week. I have to sometimes use another program, and at times when it doesn’t work I have quickly jusmped on GTM and it ‘saves the day” every time! I love the new TRANSCRIPTION feature too! And so do my students. Granted it isn’t perfect, but what speech-to-text feature is?  I make sure to use GTM and introduce it to my students at least once per course. The following week I will switch back to the other program, and then I let my students vote on which program they’d prefer to use the following week – GTM wins every time! I have used other online VOI chat tools, but they seem to keep changing?! They ""think"" they're making improvements, but take away such a valuable feature as being able to share the moderator's entire screen?! Why?! Either that or their newer version cannot “handle” sharing the entire screen and errors out showing the same screen over and over again in a trail of overlapping screens that run off into infinity. GTM is just easier to use! Inviting attendees is even easy – just set up a future meeting and the email invitation is created for you! Easy peasy!   I just took a another look at it again and played around with resizing and moving the feature windows and I even found something else about it that I didn't know before...so now I love it even more!"
"I think it's a great essential service to all companies for smooth and fast communication, especially when staff are over the place in different cities, so having this service helps bring everyone together despite the distances."
"Overall experience is nice, it helps in delivering work and makes it look so easy to manage the work with the best communication medium. It has got great customer support too with great privacy and even cost efficient. Best in business, delivers what it promises."
"We love GoToMeeting because it's mostly simple and straightforward.  Support for the product is great.  Every issue we had was answered within minutes of our call.  The pricing is adequate considering how many participants you can have on each meeting.  Overall, I recommend GoToMeeting as gold standard right up there with WebEx and JoinMe.  GoToMeeting is in my opinion more reliable and has easier setup."
Over it work great and been the bone for our dIaily meetings with screen share and easy to work.
"Really great tool. I like the sharing options and once it's loaded, it can be very fast. It has a great reputation and I've never had to use the support. "
"It's easier for us to get in touch with our customers whenever required, fast and in a reliable way. For us it saved a lot of time instead of us travelling to customer places to check what's going on at customers end and provide a solution. Right at where i'm sitting, i'm able to gather the audience in just one single interface to save time and costs."
GoToMeeting has been a solid online meeting application. The costs really limit our amount of licenses.
"I always feel comfortable when using GoToMeeting since there are fewer technical problems, if none, mostly when the parties involved are from different locations in the world and different companies with multiple IT infrastructure. You hardly have a problem with the firewall and many local numbers are available to calling-in. "
With the help of this software now I am able to work even when I am not physically present. This makes my job very easy. And I have suggested this software to many of ny clients they also seems to be liking this tool. Honestly I am very satisfied on its features. I would highly recommend this to everyone who does international business.
The business problem we solve with GoToMeeting is simple: we needed a solution that any of our external clients can easily access and join meetings with our teams from any device they might have. We wanted a solution which gives us and our clients a familiar feature set along with easy to use controls so we don't need to worry about spending parts of meetings waiting for people to install complex software just to join a simple meeting.
I like the idea that I GoTo Meeting can be used as a remote application that will allow me to speak to my vendors and suppliers while in different cities or countries.
I feel this is a must for every business big or small.  Very convenient and user friendly.  Great audio and visual quality.  Trying to convince senior leadership to obtain a more Join a Meeting conference numbers.  This will maximize productivity and cut down on face to face meetings that tend to get lengthy and get side tracked.
An awesome solution that made my online client meeting uninterrupted. Works with low bandwidth as well.  Affordable solution for all segments. 
"I use GoToMeeting on a regular basis to have meetings with coworkers and colleagues and it is mostly flawless for those purposes. Meetings sometimes get delayed  due to someone having an audio or other connection issue but not often enough for it to be a big problem. One of the most valuable uses is for remote presentations. We hold conferences and judging events where the presenter is unable to be there in person so using GoToMeeting, they are able to present their PowerPoints and interact with the audience in real  time almost as seamlessly as if they were there. My biggest recommendation is to always test important meetings and presentations where time and presentation are important factors with the actual connections and computers that will be used at the time of the actual meeting.  "
"I am able to meet with my clients virtually which helps geography, illness, and winter weather not be as big of an issue. I am glad that it integrates with Acuity, another software system that I use. "
"I've used WebEx, Join.Me and GoToMeeting for work. GoToMeeting is by far the easiest and has the fewest issues when customers or myself are trying to log in. Watching back my call recordings, it's not pixelated or laggy which is amazing! It helps me provide a quality call with my customers and prospects. "
"My CEO and other HOD's always prefer to use Goto meeting to make the external meeting due to easy connect feature and external participant doesn't need to register. Also, all interview candidate, one to one external meetings are pretty flexible via Goto meeting. But for group meeting like internal including customize feature is not availale to this platform. Overall it has a significant value till now to my company to particular type of conference. I do personally use especially when I need to connect remote people where internet connection is very poor and the y can join via dialing ."
"I am solving the business problem of training remote users without having to be in the same room.  Gotomeeting allows me to do this very well.  And, as I mentioned, it allows me to see their screen and/or their video camera while we are on the Gotomeeting.  This allows for immediate problem solving and clarification of issues."
The overall experience has been fine so far but they can improve on certain things to make it better as there are other competitors in the market.
The biggest business problem we solve with GotoMeeting is handling support issues.  Very easy to show examples instead of trying to write an explanation of the issue.
"It's reliable, it allows me to share any type of file, and the device works with any type of web browser (on any device). GoToMeeting not only simplified video conferencing, it enhanced it. This was particularly true for presentations, which were often clunky because I would need to email the powerpoint file separately from the video conference call- so this centralized the whole process as a one-stop shop."
"Well, if you want to talk to your all your staff and they are not in a location, GoToMeeting is a way to connect to all of them at the same time.  This saves energy, time and cost less.  You can connect to your friends and colleagues all at the same time and do a meeting without physically being in same place.  I really enjoy this experience using it. It is super cool."
Effective communication platform need
"I have been teaching and holding meetings online for over ten years now and I have used like eight or nine different programs through the years. Some were good, but were replaced by more popular or up to date programs. GoToMeeting, for me, has been my favorite virtual meeting tool to use. I love being able to set up all the online meetings/chats I will need for the whole month in advance and that GoToMeeting will auto generate the email invitation message with the needed hyperlinks and access codes so I can easily send out to all of my attendees/students well in advance or just a few minutes before if needed. And the transcription feature is something I especially like as do my students, so they can search through it for needed information."
GoToMeeting is one of hte easiest conferencing software packages out there. It is easy to use and just works.
"GoToMeeting It has given us a great overall experience, it is very good and it helps us at work, it is very convenient at the time of the meetings and it facilitates the work, it has helped us to finish a whole time without problems and in a professional way. We love the quality of service at the time of customer service. It really is a very good software that I recommend to everyone."
"GoToMeeting is very useful and so easy to use for everyone. The one thing that I really like about it is that it provide the best services for the audio and the video conferences for the business meeting and this type of video quality does not provide any of its competitors. With the help of GoToMeeting software, we can easily communicate with anyone."
"GoToMeeting has helped my team and I connect with clients and leads in all stages without having to leave our office space. The ease of use gives us the opportunity to have back to back meetings since all you have to do is click on ""start"" and in a second you are at your next meeting."
Great with limits. There are better options out there.
The support team has been great and it has helped us realize our meeting potential. Overall GTM is a great asset to our company and we do not plan to explore other options. Call quality is reliable and that is the most important thing we can ask for. 
"I have offices, customers, account managers, partners and even developers in severalc countries.

And, as I mentioned, it allows me to see their screen and/or their video camera while we are on the Gotomeeting.  This allows for immediate problem solving and clarification of issues."
The overall experience has been fine so far but they can improve on certain things to make it better as there are other competitors in the market.
The biggest business problem we solve with GotoMeeting is handling support issues.  Very easy to show examples instead of trying to write an explanation of the issue.
"It's reliable, it allows me to share any type of file, and the device works with any type of web browser (on any device). GoToMeeting not only simplified video conferencing, it enhanced it. This was particularly true for presentations, which were often clunky because I would need to email the powerpoint file separately from the video conference call- so this centralized the whole process as a one-stop shop."
"Well, if you want to talk to your all your staff and they are not in a location, GoToMeeting is a way to connect to all of them at the same time.  This saves energy, time and cost less.  You can connect to your friends and colleagues all at the same time and do a meeting without physically being in same place.  I really enjoy this experience using it. It is super cool."
Effective communication platform need
"I have been teaching and holding meetings online for over ten years now and I have used like eight or nine different programs through the years. Some were good, but were replaced by more popular or up to date programs. GoToMeeting, for me, has been my favorite virtual meeting tool to use. I love being able to set up all the online meetings/chats I will need for the whole month in advance and that GoToMeeting will auto generate the email invitation message with the needed hyperlinks and access codes so I can easily send out to all of my attendees/students well in advance or just a few minutes before if needed. And the transcription feature is something I especially like as do my students, so they can search through it for needed information."
GoToMeeting is one of hte easiest conferencing software packages out there. It is easy to use and just works.
"GoToMeeting It has given us a great overall experience, it is very good and it helps us at work, it is very convenient at the time of the meetings and it facilitates the work, it has helped us to finish a whole time without problems and in a professional way. We love the quality of service at the time of customer service. It really is a very good software that I recommend to everyone."
"GoToMeeting is very useful and so easy to use for everyone. The one thing that I really like about it is that it provide the best services for the audio and the video conferences for the business meeting and this type of video quality does not provide any of its competitors. With the help of GoToMeeting software, we can easily communicate with anyone."
"GoToMeeting has helped my team and I connect with clients and leads in all stages without having to leave our office space. The ease of use gives us the opportunity to have back to back meetings since all you have to do is click on ""start"" and in a second you are at your next meeting."
Great with limits. There are better options out there.
The support team has been great and it has helped us realize our meeting potential. Overall GTM is a great asset to our company and we do not plan to explore other options. Call quality is reliable and that is the most important thing we can ask for. 
"I have offices, customers, account managers, partners and even developers in severalc countries. With this solution I can keep meetings or presentations everywhere in the World where I have Internet connection. The sound can be by Internet or phone call, I can share my screen ot my webcam, and aldo I can save the meeting, to keep track of it."
"GoToMeeting is an effective platform for most business needs. Just be sure that you do not require any unique support needs, or if you do that you have the time to wait and deal with the technician tango that companies like this do."
"This software works. The mobile apps run great and won't dissapoint. The addins to install on PC and Mac are lighweight and install very quickly and it still leads when connecting to different IT environments (we have never experienced having issues with a customer when using GoTo Meeting in their network), something that some remote meeting softwares haven't been able to achieve."
Very useful for conducting the live meetings with the screen sharing! 
GoTo is very integral to my work since I oversee a number of software projects and I need to ensure the stakeholders and colleagues are roped in quickly to address issues that may arise.  I enjoy the ease of use.  I just hope they stabilize audio connectivity.
GotoMeeting has been the premier corporate web chat service for a long time. They have decent customer support and respond to you within a day or so. Not bad at all. 
"I had daily meeting with my teams in latin america. Either scheduled or on  the rush, GTM never failed as the preferred tool among the C suite"
We have relished a lot from time saving to keeping social distancing while undertaking conferences. 
I was able to connect with more those that didn't know how to video/audio conference from their computers and needed to use a conference bridge phone number.
"We use slack for most of our intracompany communication, but GoToMeeting is what we use for all voice or video telecons with external parties."
"Overall this is an indispensable tool for me despite the bugs that might pop up, or because it makes it easier to conference with team members who are not able to be present at my meetings. It is also very helpful to attend a meeting when I am not able to attend in person, such as when I am sick but can not afford to miss out on a critical meeting. "
"Overall it does exactly what I need it to do, but I’m really comparing it to WebEx. With WebEx, I could record meetings, create meetings through Outlook, and it had SSO enabled. GoToMeeting seems like a step backwards, but it still gets the job done. Just a little more tedious in my opinion."
"The overall experience is really good; GTM runs flawlessly every time and it is full of options. The main con is just related to its price. However if you or your company can afford it, it is a really good option as a meeting software."
"In general I've a really good experience with GTM, the video/audio quality is remarkable, and the usability is excelent. In my humble opinion, is one of the best meeting software I've ever used."
"I love using GoToMeeting for my team meetings. It's reliable and easy to use. We have tested out other meeting solutions including Zoom, but none compare to the ease of use found with GTM. Zoom meetings, for instance, have a much different interface, and very little is intuitive about the dashboard. Conversely, GoToMeeting's dashboard is easy to understand and follow. You can also easily change your user name within a meeting, so if you are on an informal meeting with team members you might just list your first name, whereas for a client meeting you can list your full name, title, etc."
"Being able to communicate with other people in my company and the ability to have it recorded, with being able to go back and see who said what and who was suppose to do what.  Just the time of not needing to take notes is wonderful. Now I just print them out and highlight the important stuff.  GoToMeetings has made my business look larger than it is when I speak with very large companies. When I set up a GoToMeeting with them they are very impressed. It also gives me the opportunity to demonstrate our products. It's so much better than having them go to YouTube to watch a video. At GoToMeeting I demonstrate and then they can ask questions there ""real time."" If they want me to change a parameter, I can do that, right then, ""real time.""  So my experience over all is wonderful."
I use this software almost on a daily basis to communicate with team members that are not situated in the same geographical location. It is the company wide go to software for all and it does make connecting with virtual teams much simpler. I think there is something for everyone in this software and it will only get better with time.
"I love GoToMeeting (GTM)! I teach online and hold live chats sometimes 3 nights a week. I have to sometimes use another program, and at times when it doesn’t work I have quickly jusmped on GTM and it ‘saves the day” every time! I love the new TRANSCRIPTION feature too! And so do my students. Granted it isn’t perfect, but what speech-to-text feature is?  I make sure to use GTM and introduce it to my students at least once per course. The following week I will switch back to the other program, and then I let my students vote on which program they’d prefer to use the following week – GTM wins every time! I have used other online VOI chat tools, but they seem to keep changing?! They ""think"" they're making improvements, but take away such a valuable feature as being able to share the moderator's entire screen?! Why?! Either that or their newer version cannot “handle” sharing the entire screen and errors out showing the same screen over and over again in a trail of overlapping screens that run off into infinity. GTM is just easier to use! Inviting attendees is even easy – just set up a future meeting and the email invitation is created for you! Easy peasy!   I just took a another look at it again and played around with resizing and moving the feature windows and I even found something else about it that I didn't know before...so now I love it even more!"
"I think it's a great essential service to all companies for smooth and fast communication, especially when staff are over the place in different cities, so having this service helps bring everyone together despite the distances."
"Overall experience is nice, it helps in delivering work and makes it look so easy to manage the work with the best communication medium. It has got great customer support too with great privacy and even cost efficient. Best in business, delivers what it promises."
"We love GoToMeeting because it's mostly simple and straightforward.  Support for the product is great.  Every issue we had was answered within minutes of our call.  The pricing is adequate considering how many participants you can have on each meeting.  Overall, I recommend GoToMeeting as gold standard right up there with WebEx and JoinMe.  GoToMeeting is in my opinion more reliable and has easier setup."
Over it work great and been the bone for our dIaily meetings with screen share and easy to work.
"Really great tool. I like the sharing options and once it's loaded, it can be very fast. It has a great reputation and I've never had to use the support. "
"It's easier for us to get in touch with our customers whenever required, fast and in a reliable way. For us it saved a lot of time instead of us travelling to customer places to check what's going on at customers end and provide a solution. Right at where i'm sitting, i'm able to gather the audience in just one single interface to save time and costs."
GoToMeeting has been a solid online meeting application. The costs really limit our amount of licenses.
"I always feel comfortable when using GoToMeeting since there are fewer technical problems, if none, mostly when the parties involved are from different locations in the world and different companies with multiple IT infrastructure. You hardly have a problem with the firewall and many local numbers are available to calling-in. "
With the help of this software now I am able to work even when I am not physically present. This makes my job very easy. And I have suggested this software to many of ny clients they also seems to be liking this tool. Honestly I am very satisfied on its features. I would highly recommend this to everyone who does international business.
The business problem we solve with GoToMeeting is simple: we needed a solution that any of our external clients can easily access and join meetings with our teams from any device they might have. We wanted a solution which gives us and our clients a familiar feature set along with easy to use controls so we don't need to worry about spending parts of meetings waiting for people to install complex software just to join a simple meeting.
I like the idea that I GoTo Meeting can be used as a remote application that will allow me to speak to my vendors and suppliers while in different cities or countries.
I feel this is a must for every business big or small.  Very convenient and user friendly.  Great audio and visual quality.  Trying to convince senior leadership to obtain a more Join a Meeting conference numbers.  This will maximize productivity and cut down on face to face meetings that tend to get lengthy and get side tracked.
An awesome solution that made my online client meeting uninterrupted. Works with low bandwidth as well.  Affordable solution for all segments. 
"I use GoToMeeting on a regular basis to have meetings with coworkers and colleagues and it is mostly flawless for those purposes. Meetings sometimes get delayed  due to someone having an audio or other connection issue but not often enough for it to be a big problem. One of the most valuable uses is for remote presentations. We hold conferences and judging events where the presenter is unable to be there in person so using GoToMeeting, they are able to present their PowerPoints and interact with the audience in real  time almost as seamlessly as if they were there. My biggest recommendation is to always test important meetings and presentations where time and presentation are important factors with the actual connections and computers that will be used at the time of the actual meeting.  "
"I am able to meet with my clients virtually which helps geography, illness, and winter weather not be as big of an issue. I am glad that it integrates with Acuity, another software system that I use. "
"I've used WebEx, Join.Me and GoToMeeting for work. GoToMeeting is by far the easiest and has the fewest issues when customers or myself are trying to log in. Watching back my call recordings, it's not pixelated or laggy which is amazing! It helps me provide a quality call with my customers and prospects. "
"My CEO and other HOD's always prefer to use Goto meeting to make the external meeting due to easy connect feature and external participant doesn't need to register. Also, all interview candidate, one to one external meetings are pretty flexible via Goto meeting. But for group meeting like internal including customize feature is not availale to this platform. Overall it has a significant value till now to my company to particular type of conference. I do personally use especially when I need to connect remote people where internet connection is very poor and the y can join via dialing ."

"As a coach, I did not want to limit my clients to driving distance, nor do I want to keep a dedicated office that I can bring ""strangers"" into, outside of my home.  Zoom not only allows me to meet seamlessly but allows my clients to meet comfortably in their own home (and not have to worry about baby sitters, etc).   The ease of use and multi-platform support removes any compatibility worries when setting meetings. "
"I've been utilizing Zoom to talk and meet with my collaborators while we're isolated gathering. With the current pandemic, Zoom has become a practically day by day program that I abuse for both work gatherings and virtual meetups with companions. I truly like how you'll have various clients on straightforwardly. I'm prepared to speak with various video calls. I abuse them for chapel meeting week by week and that they are incredible."
We've used many different software programs to deliver our monthly webinar content and Zoom has proven to be the best program yet. It's ease of use and interactive functions are far beyond what we've used in the past and it allows us to successfully connect to our management teams monthly to deliver timely updates. 
"We use Zoom daily for meetings with many participants. The recording feature is very helpful and, provide us with an opportunity to replicate knowledge and to record important meetings."
"The Chatbox provides a valuable written transcript of the comments.  We also use the chatbox for Board voting so we know if there are differences of opinion that need to be discussed.   Recording is easy, so we can review the discussion or allow people who missed the meeting to view it.  We love the new Breakout Rooms, and Polls are great for maintaining interest."
We switched to Zoom recently and it has been serving very well. All our colleagues can easily meet online while they are doing their job at home.  It was really easy to implement and deploy on our environment.
"We started with free option at the beginning which allows 100 participant per meeting. The number of participants in a meeting is mostly less than 100 for our company. However, free option limits meeting period time to 40 minute. You need to restart the meeting every 40 minute. Therefore, after testing it for a week, we subscribed to Zoom. Overall, I am happy we chose Zoom for online meetings. In specific, online meeting tools becomes essential during these lockdown period and Zoom proved itself to us with its features and performance."
"We needed a reliable audio and video conferencing platform to use for small meetings, all hands meetings, and training, among other things.  Zoom has always fit those needs perfectly.  Meetings are easy to setup, record and the quality is always top notch."
"The quality of your meetings is much better than most videoconferencing platforms, so if it's a little less intuitive, it's probably still worth it.  And the free tier is still great as long as your meetings are 40 minutes long or less."
"If the speaker has bad internet quality, it will be super hard to concentrate and understand what's going on in the lecture. Not sure if Zoom is capable of tuning down the video quality, for example, to compensate for the bad quality audio. It doesn't seem to be the case whenever my host got cut out. "
"I usually conduct site inspections by going to the site, but due to the limitations arisen as a result of the pandemic I have to conduct these meetings and inspections virtually. The picture quality is top-notch and there is no lag especially in video. With a good internet connection, there is literally nothing we can't do as a remote team. Previously we were deploying Zoom as a conferencing tool for only international conferencing, or limited requirements, however now we are utilizing it for all of our meetings, video conferences and audio calls on a daily basis."
"The software has been essential to our business. We use the video and audio connection, the screen sharing, the white board, and the chat functions."
"Our organization is able to work around the world, thanks to Zoom. We couldn't do our jobs without it. Videoconferencing isn't a perfect replacement for in-person communication, but it's a lot better than just email or text. And lots of people are using it for non-business purposes these days and experiencing the benefits of video calls to replace social engagements, or just to facilitate conversations with people who are far away. The negative press is really unfortunate, because it's not the platform's fault - but the fault of malicious people using it in unintended ways. If Zoom wasn't so successful, it wouldn't be getting attention from people with evil intentions. We'll still use Zoom long after this has blown over, and are thankful for how it enables us to work efficiently even with a distributed team."
"Overall, Zoom Meetings & Chat has become a great way to get work done in a simple manner. Everyone is online now, and in person conferences are outdated. Whether you're working from home, remotely, or need several members in different states to jump on a conference, and watch your screen for training purposes, I would recommend it.  Overall it is pretty easy to use, but I would definitely RUN A TEST MEETING FIRST with at least one other person so you can guide colleagues accessing it for the first time.  I have used other video meetings, and Zoom has worked seamlessly for me. Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too.   I will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while."
"Right now, my company is moving all language classes to Zoom for the foreseeable future until further notice, in order to commit to social distancing during the coronavirus crisis within the Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan regions. Although we are still within the first two weeks of transition, it has been a smooth one overall and both teachers and students (as well as company administrators) seem pleased enough in spite of the vast differences between virtual learning and in-person classes."
"We have remote team members all over the World and we have a standup everyday. Using good video really does make the personal connection stronger and the team works better with a stronger human bond.  The Slack integration is great. On a whim, we can go from chatting to Zoom by using ""/zoom"" in the Slack channel. This takes an issue from email, tickets, and chatting to a shared video conference where we can share screens and see what people are looking at and get resolutions faster."
"For a period of time, I solely worked from home because I had young children. Zoom was a game changer for me! I was able to be present for staff meetings, have regular meetings with my boss(es) to discuss tasks & meet with other staff when needed to coordinate projects or train others. It was instrumental in allowing me to work from home and still stay connected to the team and on the right path with my tasks! "
"Not great. It connects and works, as long as you're not using AirPods. "
"Zoom brings so much to the table. It really is a dream come true software. People can save on travel, share their work and communicate their ideas from the comfort of their own home or office. What a great software!!!!!"
"Overall zoom is a great tool for meetings and webinar. People can also join without host joining the call. So, you don't have to wait till host's join. It's quick and the phone app works well to. I like the UI It's simple and easy to send an invite. We used to do all meeting including international ones with zoom only and if the internet is good, I never faced and drop or lags in the call. "
"We are all able to share screens and see the same content together, at the same time. We do not have to email our spreadsheets or presentations before the meeting, constantly reminding everyone where to look or what we are discussing to stay on topic. We are able to see our team's faces for better communication, which leads to better understanding and interaction."
"Overall my experience with Zoom has been overwhelmingly positive. Once you get over the initial bumps in the road to figure out how to best use it, it shines as a software. I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing."
"Zoom has been a great investment for us.  We have never had software or any tool so quickly adopted by our users.  By using Zoom, we have cut costs on video conferencing and allowed ourselves to do more with less in regards to conferencing.  It has become the go to collaboration tool, and more user are doing video conferencing/screen sharing than they ever did with another tool. "
I am very happy with our choice to move to Zoom. It is not very resource intensive and is more cost effective than Webex. No additional 'Firewall work' was needed to get it going on our network and the interface is clean. The web admin console is easy to use and makes managing licenses a breeze. We are able to save on the amount of licenses needed as non licensed user still has 45 minutes of meeting time. Users are normally prompted very clearly about how soon the 45min time will elapse and it helps to wrap up meetings. I highly recommend Zoom for any size organization. 
"Zoom meetings are reliable, clear, and easy to use most of the time. "
"Overall our team loves it. We use it everyday, haven't had any major issues, and they constantly update their features and fix minor bug issues. "
"We use Zoom for all our internal and external conferencing requirements, so we no longer need a seperate video and call conferencing. Our overall experience in this regard has been excellent and a very positive change."
"It just works. It's so easy to integrate with Google Calendar to schedule and send a link, and also in the paid version we use, the call recording feature is a lifesaver. Everything is made to fit most businesses needs."
"Our organization's members are spread all over Northeast Ohio, and Zoom lets folks be face to face during a meeting, even when distance, weather, and other complications make in-person meeting impractical."
"Overall, I really like Zoom a lot.  It's now my main software tool for business and video conferences.  It's got great video quality, and it works great on my devices.  I also like that there isn't this huge ordeal to use it's system.  It's got a great reputation, and almost all of the people I do business with know what Zoom is, and also already use it, so that makes it extremely easy on me as well! "
A great solution for calls with more than 2 parties. Screen sharing is easy to use and can be passed between attendees quickly and easily. Online chat lets you post links for everyone to find/follow. Software is fast and doesn't require constant updating/downloading. Launches quickly.
"Zoom Meeting is a really good application for a new or existing user, You can dial PM for any particular person n u will be ib VC call. If you need to support remotly you can use the Zoom meeting. By using the chat option you can chat with private mode or you can broadcast your message."
"It would be great if it could just detect and connect audio and microphone automatically, but otherwise it has all the features you'd need, it's reliable, the quality is great and we also use zoom rooms, which is the easiest way to connect to meetings in all our conference rooms. I think it's a brilliant piece of software."
"I originally started using Zoom with a client who had a client out of state. I was really impressed with the interface and brought it into my own team. It's allowed us to expand our customer base seamlessly out of town, and drastically cut down on unnecessary travel. "
"My overall experience is excellent, except for the two comments mentioned before, everything else is perfect and works flawlessly."
"Again, the issues I am highlighting are fairly nit picky as Zoom is vastly superior to the previous product we were using (Goto Meeting)"
"Using Zoom was great especially for organizations that need to take HIPAA compliance into consideration. Since Zoom encrypts connections end to end, it works out great. It also was really easy to use their API, and it was very well documented. We rarely had issues with reliability through Zoom being used directly within our software. I thought it was very easy to use, and a much better option than most other video platforms. We also made great use of the reporting mechanism to know how much utilization we were getting out of Zoom. And the meetings that we generated across the organization, since we purchased an API subscription, were easy to customize for the settings on each meeting.   I do think generating meetings in Zoom is kind of inconvenient. There is a lot of information that must be copied and pasted into meeting invites and people often have questions about what link they should use. "
"Solves the problem of meeting with people outside of the office with great quality audio, video and sharing. And constantly adding new, great features!"
"By using Zoom meetings, I am able to record for both, my audio podcasts and my video training programs by using one simple software. Prior to using Zoom, I was using two and sometimes three different platforms to accomplish the same thing I can do through Zoom!"
"My overall experience with Zoom is extremely good. The software is lightweight but very heavy hitting. It is packed with important features, controls and abilities. I feel this software one of the best on the market for audio video conferencing.  "
"We have used Zoom for a little over a year and it has been an amazing experience.  We moved to Zoom from Webex, after people constantly having issues with that platform.  Zoom has been a night and day difference with user satisfaction sitting at a much higher rate than it was before.  "
"As I said earlier, Zoom is far superior to other tools in the market, even in its free version. We use it in our conference rooms and personal computers, with very good results in all scenarios (demos, support, remote daily meetings, etc.). Very user friendly and works really fast!"
Overall really positive experience with the software as well as the sales and support teams.
"I could not be happier. Our institution has standardized on it, and it was one of the best I.T. business decisions we have made in the last 5 years."
"I use this product for countless meetings and I have always recommended it to co-workers. As a project manager, I often throw together meetings to have quick agile discussions with stakeholders and ZOOM allows me to do just that. Even external clients with no experience using ZOOM can access it and use it with little issue. As with all products, the more people are comfortable with the tools that ZOOM provides, the greater collaboration can be. Once people understand this, they find ZOOM to be one of the best tools for their day-to-day and begin scheduling their own web conferences. I think that alone demonstrates how useful ZOOM can be."
Zoom is a worthy competitor to GoToMeeting and Webex even if it still lacks some useful features. It does excel in large group environments and video screen participation. 
My overall experience has been very good and we have solidly used at least 2 other leaders in this category over the past 2-5 years.
Try the demo and see if it works best for your business. I know that I don't have any regrets.
"My experience with Zoom Meetings and Chat has been great. It's quickly become one of our team's most valuable collaboration tools. It feels like a shared meeting platform that's truly collaborative. Instead of one person starting and running a meeting, we can each step in and lead on-the-fly, naturally. So far, this platform feels more like your team being in the same room together than other professional meeting platforms."
"While we survived on the free platform for a long while at one point, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the paid version to others as the features really add a lot of robustness. Any business that hasn't caught on to video chats can try this product for free and learn what they are missing! "
"As a coach, I did not want to limit my clients to driving distance, nor do I want to keep a dedicated office that I can bring ""strangers"" into, outside of my home.  Zoom not only allows me to meet seamlessly but allows my clients to meet comfortably in their own home (and not have to worry about baby sitters, etc).   The ease of use and multi-platform support removes any compatibility worries when setting meetings. "
"I've been utilizing Zoom to talk and meet with my collaborators while we're isolated gathering. With the current pandemic, Zoom has become a practically day by day program that I abuse for both work gatherings and virtual meetups with companions. I truly like how you'll have various clients on straightforwardly. I'm prepared to speak with various video calls. I abuse them for chapel meeting week by week and that they are incredible."
We've used many different software programs to deliver our monthly webinar content and Zoom has proven to be the best program yet. It's ease of use and interactive functions are far beyond what we've used in the past and it allows us to successfully connect to our management teams monthly to deliver timely updates. 
"We use Zoom daily for meetings with many participants. The recording feature is very helpful and, provide us with an opportunity to replicate knowledge and to record important meetings."
"The Chatbox provides a valuable written transcript of the comments.  We also use the chatbox for Board voting so we know if there are differences of opinion that need to be discussed.   Recording is easy, so we can review the discussion or allow people who missed the meeting to view it.  We love the new Breakout Rooms, and Polls are great for maintaining interest."
We switched to Zoom recently and it has been serving very well. All our colleagues can easily meet online while they are doing their job at home.  It was really easy to implement and deploy on our environment.
"We started with free option at the beginning which allows 100 participant per meeting. The number of participants in a meeting is mostly less than 100 for our company. However, free option limits meeting period time to 40 minute. You need to restart the meeting every 40 minute. Therefore, after testing it for a week, we subscribed to Zoom. Overall, I am happy we chose Zoom for online meetings. In specific, online meeting tools becomes essential during these lockdown period and Zoom proved itself to us with its features and performance."
"We needed a reliable audio and video conferencing platform to use for small meetings, all hands meetings, and training, among other things.  Zoom has always fit those needs perfectly.  Meetings are easy to setup, record and the quality is always top notch."

Using good video really does make the personal connection stronger and the team works better with a stronger human bond.  The Slack integration is great. On a whim, we can go from chatting to Zoom by using ""/zoom"" in the Slack channel. This takes an issue from email, tickets, and chatting to a shared video conference where we can share screens and see what people are looking at and get resolutions faster."
"For a period of time, I solely worked from home because I had young children. Zoom was a game changer for me! I was able to be present for staff meetings, have regular meetings with my boss(es) to discuss tasks & meet with other staff when needed to coordinate projects or train others. It was instrumental in allowing me to work from home and still stay connected to the team and on the right path with my tasks! "
"Not great. It connects and works, as long as you're not using AirPods. "
"Zoom brings so much to the table. It really is a dream come true software. People can save on travel, share their work and communicate their ideas from the comfort of their own home or office. What a great software!!!!!"
"Overall zoom is a great tool for meetings and webinar. People can also join without host joining the call. So, you don't have to wait till host's join. It's quick and the phone app works well to. I like the UI It's simple and easy to send an invite. We used to do all meeting including international ones with zoom only and if the internet is good, I never faced and drop or lags in the call. "
"We are all able to share screens and see the same content together, at the same time. We do not have to email our spreadsheets or presentations before the meeting, constantly reminding everyone where to look or what we are discussing to stay on topic. We are able to see our team's faces for better communication, which leads to better understanding and interaction."
"Overall my experience with Zoom has been overwhelmingly positive. Once you get over the initial bumps in the road to figure out how to best use it, it shines as a software. I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing."
"Zoom has been a great investment for us.  We have never had software or any tool so quickly adopted by our users.  By using Zoom, we have cut costs on video conferencing and allowed ourselves to do more with less in regards to conferencing.  It has become the go to collaboration tool, and more user are doing video conferencing/screen sharing than they ever did with another tool. "
I am very happy with our choice to move to Zoom. It is not very resource intensive and is more cost effective than Webex. No additional 'Firewall work' was needed to get it going on our network and the interface is clean. The web admin console is easy to use and makes managing licenses a breeze. We are able to save on the amount of licenses needed as non licensed user still has 45 minutes of meeting time. Users are normally prompted very clearly about how soon the 45min time will elapse and it helps to wrap up meetings. I highly recommend Zoom for any size organization. 
"Zoom meetings are reliable, clear, and easy to use most of the time. "
"Overall our team loves it. We use it everyday, haven't had any major issues, and they constantly update their features and fix minor bug issues. "
"We use Zoom for all our internal and external conferencing requirements, so we no longer need a seperate video and call conferencing. Our overall experience in this regard has been excellent and a very positive change."
"It just works. It's so easy to integrate with Google Calendar to schedule and send a link, and also in the paid version we use, the call recording feature is a lifesaver. Everything is made to fit most businesses needs."
"Our organization's members are spread all over Northeast Ohio, and Zoom lets folks be face to face during a meeting, even when distance, weather, and other complications make in-person meeting impractical."
"Overall, I really like Zoom a lot.  It's now my main software tool for business and video conferences.  It's got great video quality, and it works great on my devices.  I also like that there isn't this huge ordeal to use it's system.  It's got a great reputation, and almost all of the people I do business with know what Zoom is, and also already use it, so that makes it extremely easy on me as well! "
A great solution for calls with more than 2 parties. Screen sharing is easy to use and can be passed between attendees quickly and easily. Online chat lets you post links for everyone to find/follow. Software is fast and doesn't require constant updating/downloading. Launches quickly.
"Zoom Meeting is a really good application for a new or existing user, You can dial PM for any particular person n u will be ib VC call. If you need to support remotly you can use the Zoom meeting. By using the chat option you can chat with private mode or you can broadcast your message."
"It would be great if it could just detect and connect audio and microphone automatically, but otherwise it has all the features you'd need, it's reliable, the quality is great and we also use zoom rooms, which is the easiest way to connect to meetings in all our conference rooms. I think it's a brilliant piece of software."
"I originally started using Zoom with a client who had a client out of state. I was really impressed with the interface and brought it into my own team. It's allowed us to expand our customer base seamlessly out of town, and drastically cut down on unnecessary travel. "
"My overall experience is excellent, except for the two comments mentioned before, everything else is perfect and works flawlessly."
"Again, the issues I am highlighting are fairly nit picky as Zoom is vastly superior to the previous product we were using (Goto Meeting)"
"Using Zoom was great especially for organizations that need to take HIPAA compliance into consideration. Since Zoom encrypts connections end to end, it works out great. It also was really easy to use their API, and it was very well documented. We rarely had issues with reliability through Zoom being used directly within our software. I thought it was very easy to use, and a much better option than most other video platforms. We also made great use of the reporting mechanism to know how much utilization we were getting out of Zoom. And the meetings that we generated across the organization, since we purchased an API subscription, were easy to customize for the settings on each meeting.   I do think generating meetings in Zoom is kind of inconvenient. There is a lot of information that must be copied and pasted into meeting invites and people often have questions about what link they should use. "
"Solves the problem of meeting with people outside of the office with great quality audio, video and sharing. And constantly adding new, great features!"
"By using Zoom meetings, I am able to record for both, my audio podcasts and my video training programs by using one simple software. Prior to using Zoom, I was using two and sometimes three different platforms to accomplish the same thing I can do through Zoom!"
"My overall experience with Zoom is extremely good. The software is lightweight but very heavy hitting. It is packed with important features, controls and abilities. I feel this software one of the best on the market for audio video conferencing.  "
"We have used Zoom for a little over a year and it has been an amazing experience.  We moved to Zoom from Webex, after people constantly having issues with that platform.  Zoom has been a night and day difference with user satisfaction sitting at a much higher rate than it was before.  "
"As I said earlier, Zoom is far superior to other tools in the market, even in its free version. We use it in our conference rooms and personal computers, with very good results in all scenarios (demos, support, remote daily meetings, etc.). Very user friendly and works really fast!"
Overall really positive experience with the software as well as the sales and support teams.
"I could not be happier. Our institution has standardized on it, and it was one of the best I.T. business decisions we have made in the last 5 years."
"I use this product for countless meetings and I have always recommended it to co-workers. As a project manager, I often throw together meetings to have quick agile discussions with stakeholders and ZOOM allows me to do just that. Even external clients with no experience using ZOOM can access it and use it with little issue. As with all products, the more people are comfortable with the tools that ZOOM provides, the greater collaboration can be. Once people understand this, they find ZOOM to be one of the best tools for their day-to-day and begin scheduling their own web conferences. I think that alone demonstrates how useful ZOOM can be."
Zoom is a worthy competitor to GoToMeeting and Webex even if it still lacks some useful features. It does excel in large group environments and video screen participation. 
My overall experience has been very good and we have solidly used at least 2 other leaders in this category over the past 2-5 years.
Try the demo and see if it works best for your business. I know that I don't have any regrets.
"My experience with Zoom Meetings and Chat has been great. It's quickly become one of our team's most valuable collaboration tools. It feels like a shared meeting platform that's truly collaborative. Instead of one person starting and running a meeting, we can each step in and lead on-the-fly, naturally. So far, this platform feels more like your team being in the same room together than other professional meeting platforms."
"While we survived on the free platform for a long while at one point, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the paid version to others as the features really add a lot of robustness. Any business that hasn't caught on to video chats can try this product for free and learn what they are missing! "
"As a coach, I did not want to limit my clients to driving distance, nor do I want to keep a dedicated office that I can bring ""strangers"" into, outside of my home.  Zoom not only allows me to meet seamlessly but allows my clients to meet comfortably in their own home (and not have to worry about baby sitters, etc).   The ease of use and multi-platform support removes any compatibility worries when setting meetings. "
"I've been utilizing Zoom to talk and meet with my collaborators while we're isolated gathering. With the current pandemic, Zoom has become a practically day by day program that I abuse for both work gatherings and virtual meetups with companions. I truly like how you'll have various clients on straightforwardly. I'm prepared to speak with various video calls. I abuse them for chapel meeting week by week and that they are incredible."
We've used many different software programs to deliver our monthly webinar content and Zoom has proven to be the best program yet. It's ease of use and interactive functions are far beyond what we've used in the past and it allows us to successfully connect to our management teams monthly to deliver timely updates. 
"We use Zoom daily for meetings with many participants. The recording feature is very helpful and, provide us with an opportunity to replicate knowledge and to record important meetings."
"The Chatbox provides a valuable written transcript of the comments.  We also use the chatbox for Board voting so we know if there are differences of opinion that need to be discussed.   Recording is easy, so we can review the discussion or allow people who missed the meeting to view it.  We love the new Breakout Rooms, and Polls are great for maintaining interest."
We switched to Zoom recently and it has been serving very well. All our colleagues can easily meet online while they are doing their job at home.  It was really easy to implement and deploy on our environment.
"We started with free option at the beginning which allows 100 participant per meeting. The number of participants in a meeting is mostly less than 100 for our company. However, free option limits meeting period time to 40 minute. You need to restart the meeting every 40 minute. Therefore, after testing it for a week, we subscribed to Zoom. Overall, I am happy we chose Zoom for online meetings. In specific, online meeting tools becomes essential during these lockdown period and Zoom proved itself to us with its features and performance."
"We needed a reliable audio and video conferencing platform to use for small meetings, all hands meetings, and training, among other things.  Zoom has always fit those needs perfectly.  Meetings are easy to setup, record and the quality is always top notch."
"The quality of your meetings is much better than most videoconferencing platforms, so if it's a little less intuitive, it's probably still worth it.  And the free tier is still great as long as your meetings are 40 minutes long or less."
"If the speaker has bad internet quality, it will be super hard to concentrate and understand what's going on in the lecture. Not sure if Zoom is capable of tuning down the video quality, for example, to compensate for the bad quality audio. It doesn't seem to be the case whenever my host got cut out. "
"I usually conduct site inspections by going to the site, but due to the limitations arisen as a result of the pandemic I have to conduct these meetings and inspections virtually. The picture quality is top-notch and there is no lag especially in video. With a good internet connection, there is literally nothing we can't do as a remote team. Previously we were deploying Zoom as a conferencing tool for only international conferencing, or limited requirements, however now we are utilizing it for all of our meetings, video conferences and audio calls on a daily basis."
"The software has been essential to our business. We use the video and audio connection, the screen sharing, the white board, and the chat functions."
"Our organization is able to work around the world, thanks to Zoom. We couldn't do our jobs without it. Videoconferencing isn't a perfect replacement for in-person communication, but it's a lot better than just email or text. And lots of people are using it for non-business purposes these days and experiencing the benefits of video calls to replace social engagements, or just to facilitate conversations with people who are far away. The negative press is really unfortunate, because it's not the platform's fault - but the fault of malicious people using it in unintended ways. If Zoom wasn't so successful, it wouldn't be getting attention from people with evil intentions. We'll still use Zoom long after this has blown over, and are thankful for how it enables us to work efficiently even with a distributed team."
"Overall, Zoom Meetings & Chat has become a great way to get work done in a simple manner. Everyone is online now, and in person conferences are outdated. Whether you're working from home, remotely, or need several members in different states to jump on a conference, and watch your screen for training purposes, I would recommend it.  Overall it is pretty easy to use, but I would definitely RUN A TEST MEETING FIRST with at least one other person so you can guide colleagues accessing it for the first time.  I have used other video meetings, and Zoom has worked seamlessly for me. Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too.   I will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while."
"Right now, my company is moving all language classes to Zoom for the foreseeable future until further notice, in order to commit to social distancing during the coronavirus crisis within the Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan regions. Although we are still within the first two weeks of transition, it has been a smooth one overall and both teachers and students (as well as company administrators) seem pleased enough in spite of the vast differences between virtual learning and in-person classes."

We have a pro account with 8 paid host licenses.  We have had a billing issue since day 1 and I have been unable to get support on the issue.  I have two support tickets open with them and NO response.  I have now opened a third ticket. I have made multiple calls to their billing department but just stay on hold for a long time then eventually gets answered by an answering service and they take your info so they can call you back.  Been waiting for a call back for a month now.

"The fact that they claim that you have 40min time limit when using the free version but then they cut you off suddenly after 30-35mins makes me not trust them. They straight up lie and then have the nerve to ask me to upgrade. I really wanted to get the Pro version, but NO thank you, I can't trust liars with my credit card.             "
"So, when you try and enter a meeting, the computer app will crash 8 times. The phone app will crash at the same time. And you’ll totally miss the essential meeting because Zoom’s update crashed the entire computer.  Even then, the paid version is overpriced for what it is.  So thanks Zoom. Wish everyone still used Skype.             "
"My experience matches that of most people, it seems. The product is good (except for constantly changing and confusing functionality and one day of no service at a couple of weeks ago). Customer service is utterly appalling, in fact seems to be non existent. They are billing me twice every month at the moment and will not reply to emails. Their robot chat facility on their website is utterly useless. Not sure want to do. I like the product, on the whole, but don’t want to go on paying double for it every month, so time to start looking elsewhere, I think. What a shame, this company should be making a massive success of this product at the moment.             "
"Great video conferencing service. Very, very poor service. Never could get phone service to set up properly and asked for a refund and to cancel. Got a reply on May 9 that they were looking into it. Never heard back. Just realized that they charged me for a second month. Using Skype or Teams for my phone service. Starting to look for options to Zoom for video and webinars.

"This is what I wrote to PayPal and I am pretty confident I will get some of my money back. ""I made multiple attempts to change my zoom account from 2 licensees to 1 license throughout the month of May. These attempts included trying to use the website to change it which consistently resulted in an error that was being worked on. I called on two occasions and after sitting on hold for an unbelievable length of time, I was put through to an answering service that took my information and concern and said someone would be in touch with me. This never happened.  I also emailed the company twice and received no response. Ultimately, I wish I would have just canceled the subscription all together, which is what I did on the day I was notified they still charged my account for two licensees. I think that transaction is fraud, but since my request was to keep one license, then I am willing to pay that amount. Unfortunately, the ability to provide any proof of my attempts to rectify this problem can not be provided since, other than taking screen shots, everything is embedded in their site. I am disgusted in the terrible customer service and plan on filing a complaint with the BBB as well.

It's ideal for sharing resources with students. It is less appropriate for classes that need intensive explicit teaching of concepts because it lacks a convenient way to record video.
"Google Classroom works well in my classroom for students who need to be able to work independently. Students who do not have technology at home can struggle to complete all the work. Google Classroom is also a great tool when I have a substitute teacher, because I can create and monitor assignments while not in the classroom. Students can be independent and work."
"One scenario where Google Classroom is well suited is in having students respond to a prompt at the beginning of each class. Students log into the computers, go to Google Classroom, and see the prompt posted in ""stream"" or under ""classwork."" Depending on the settings, students can then comment on each other's posts, enabling a sense of collaboration with the students.One scenario where Google Classroom is less appropriate is on an assignment with Google Slides. It becomes a bit wonky for students to access each time they are working on the assignment, and I have found that they frequently get lost trying to return to it."
It works great in the educational or training environment.  It may be less suites for other cooperate uses.
Google Classroom is perfect for an educational environment in which multiple staff members are working with a group of students. It's also fantastic for creating assignments and making sure students are on task with their work.
"This is well suited for individualized learning, small classes, big classes, and everything in between. It is easy to use and the kids enjoy it. I appreciate that I can do discussion and assign projects to certain students and not others. I also enjoy that I am able to access all my drive documents from this one site and add them and distribute them to my students at one time."
"Google Classroom is well suited for all modern educators because it allows us to stay current with technological advancements in the times we live in. Our students are more tech-savvy than ever, with phones and tablets persistent in the classrooms. Our students are online more often than they are offline, and to reach them, we need to get our classrooms online, which is precisely what Google Classroom does."
"Google Classroom is well suited to a secondary school environment where the goal is to go paperless in terms of assignments, where teachers would benefit from automated organization help and where a fully functioning LMS that is integrated with an SIS is not available. This product is less suitable in a primary years environment."
Google Classroom is very user-friendly and easy to figure out.  My students are familiar with it and easily integrated when signing up.  Google Classroom does a great job of communicating new content to students via email.  It would be even more helpful if they would receive SMS messaging through Google Classroom when new content is available.
Perfect for classroom use when sharing materials that all students will need.The quiz mode is great to use when trying to keep students from getting other websites during assessments.It’s great that as a teacher I can always check in on the progress of my students as they work on an assignment. 
Google classroom can be adapted very easily to suit the needs of staff development in any industry.
"Google classroom works well in most classroom settings. Any time where there is a need for one person to communicate with several other people is probably where google classroom could be incorporated. It's mainly designed for the classroom setting, though. It could also work if you were hosting a workshop where you wanted people to access your handouts and then turn them back in."
Google Classroom is well suited to making sure students have assigned tasks and for scheduling assignments. It is well suited for integrating a full spectrum of resources to make access easy for younger students.
"As I mentioned previously, Google Classroom has some brilliant features.  A depository for all the necessary assignment materials, with the instructions, which can be referred back to by students at their convenience is great!  "
"I would recommend it highly to a colleague because first, it is free. It is very easy to set-up and extremely useful for teachers. Students in the classroom can also reply to other student's posts. Plus it also gives you quick access to other Google apps like Docs and Slides to view students' work."
Google Classroom is wells suited for beginners and new learners. It is highly suited for people who have recently joined their jobs and undergoing special workshops. It will help them knowing everyone in the group and will lead to a better understanding of thing and rules which are implemented in the organization.
"At first, it can be a bit complex to use or learn how to handle. But after you have more practice, it becomes very easy and simple. The first time you use it it may be difficult to create different groups for each subject, but the more you use it, the easier it becomes. I really like that you can create exams quickly in Google Classroom."
"As a technology integrator that serves two elementary schools, I have seen Google Classroom used in grades K-5. While many teachers use the platform for a variety of tasks, the best use case I've seen is to use it for writing instruction and project creation. In writing, the teacher has instant access to students' work which allows the teacher a quicker response time for leaving comments/feedback within Google Docs which helps guide student writing during the process of writing, not just as a final product analysis. In project creation, teachers can create one template (for example a Google Slides template with a topic on each slide) and share it so that each student gets their own template to customize. From there, the teacher has instant access for comments/feedback. For younger students, Google Classroom is great for sharing links and basic content creation, but students may find it a bit more challenging to access if they have to enter district-created Google logins."
"I use Google Classroom for all of the classes I teach at my high school. I'm in a computer lab, but Google Classroom could also be used for teachers who do not have computers for students to use in class. It allows me to post announcements, assignments, worksheets, online resources, quizzes, and pretty much anything class-related in an easy-to-use interface. However, it currently does not include a very detailed gradebook. I have to keep separate spreadsheets with my students' grades in order to use weighted categories."
"As stated before, Google Classroom would be well suited for an instructor that wants students to have access to a large portion of information related to the class. It may be less appropriate to use as a school-wide site."
"Google classroom is well suited for a 3rd grade and up classroom. It is especially well suited for middle and high school where students are more well-versed in using technology. It allows teachers to easily share assignments with students and grade those assignments quickly and without paper. It might not be as useful in classrooms that do not have 1:1 technology, as it would be harder for students to finish assignments on time."
"Google Classroom is suitable for any classroom setting from grades 3 to the collegiate level. Students are easily and quickly engaged and can maintain communication with teachers beyond normal teaching hours. Students can submit their work and receive grades directly on the site, and they are able to share resources with others for group projects or other collaborative settings."
"I believe Google Classroom is well-suited for any classroom in education. It is great for posting announcements, assignments, and class material. It is also a great method of online learning when an in-class session is not possible (snow days, homework to be completed at home, etc.) It would be less appropriate in scenarios outside of education, although the means of communication are easy."
"Google Classroom is best suited to a fixed group of users where everyone is a managed Google user within a G-Suite environment. We have an often transient group of learners, some of whom are not within our managed network of Google users. Therefore, our situation may not be ideal."
"For classroom teachers, it is ACES. Even if an instructor is using it just as a repository for student work it's fantastic. Google Classroom can aid you in becoming a paperless classroom or just reducing some of the copies that you are making. If YouTube is blocked in your school, you can post links for students to view at home (or on their phones). Google classroom can help high school or college level teachers keep their learning environments ORGANIZED."

"Google classroom is well suited for a 3rd grade and up classroom. It is especially well suited for middle and high school where students are more well-versed in using technology. It allows teachers to easily share assignments with students and grade those assignments quickly and without paper. It might not be as useful in classrooms that do not have 1:1 technology, as it would be harder for students to finish assignments on time."
"Google Classroom is suitable for any classroom setting from grades 3 to the collegiate level. Students are easily and quickly engaged and can maintain communication with teachers beyond normal teaching hours. Students can submit their work and receive grades directly on the site, and they are able to share resources with others for group projects or other collaborative settings."
"I believe Google Classroom is well-suited for any classroom in education. It is great for posting announcements, assignments, and class material. It is also a great method of online learning when an in-class session is not possible (snow days, homework to be completed at home, etc.) It would be less appropriate in scenarios outside of education, although the means of communication are easy."
"Google Classroom is best suited to a fixed group of users where everyone is a managed Google user within a G-Suite environment. We have an often transient group of learners, some of whom are not within our managed network of Google users. Therefore, our situation may not be ideal."
"For classroom teachers, it is ACES. Even if an instructor is using it just as a repository for student work it's fantastic. Google Classroom can aid you in becoming a paperless classroom or just reducing some of the copies that you are making. If YouTube is blocked in your school, you can post links for students to view at home (or on their phones). Google classroom can help high school or college level teachers keep their learning environments ORGANIZED."
Reviews
"All in all, GoToMeeting is a promising remote meeting software due to its limitless features and functionalities.  It is a good software for attending the webinars and conducting online tutorials and teaching.  As a teacher using it, this is so far one of the best pieces of software I've used because the video and audio are clear enough that all attendees understand easily."
"On-demand or scheduled meetings where participants need to screen share and collaborate, showing design files, project plans, reports, etc.Video conferencing, including use in job interviews, team meetings, and client presentations."
"In some instances, GoToMeeting is harder to use than alternatives such as Zoom or BlueJeans in terms of video experience and in some instances is more complex than using Skype for example. At times the mobile app is inflexible when trying to switch from mobile to an internet connection in particular when entering the pin code, which is very tricky when on the move."
"If adopted by an entire department or user group, it works well as support, and training for the entire group is efficient.  If you have meetings with a mixture of technologies joining the meeting (phone, computer audio with video, computer with phone) GoToMeeting bridges seamlessly.  Video quality is excellent, users are very impressed with the jump up in quality form free platforms (Skype, Google Chat, etc)."
"GoToMeeting is suitable for users that want the option to meet with clients or customers without having to meet in person. As a large software company, we aren't in the same city, let alone the same state as most of our customers so it's important for us to have a platform that can allow for more personalized, one on one meetings. If you are working locally and often want to meet with clients in person, this software is not a good fit. There wouldn't be a purpose to it."
"My main issue with GoToMeeting is the lack of reliability. A lot of their features are really nice, especially on the recording side. The problem is that none of those features matter if the core of the product, the meeting itself, is having issues. If my audio is delayed by a couple of seconds it leads to a lot of awkward silences and people accidentally interrupting each other. When I'm setting up a meeting in a conference room, I should just be able to come in and click a button to get going."
"GoToMeeting is a great option for having to meet with clients or to show them your screen. Since end-users are not forced to download a client and can join from any web browser, it works well for inviting customers in secure locations or who don't have the rights to download applications to their computer. It does an alright job for supporting customers, but there are better options to control the customer's computer from afar."
"I highly recommend GoToMeeting. It's a great tool for meetings, webinars, training, etc. I think it's great that people in different locations can still collaborate and hold meetings, whether just audio with slides, or face-time like meetings. Given the current events with COVID-19, it's especially important to be able to have these interactions without actually coming into contact with someone."
"GoToMeeting is well suited if you need to record a screen-share session or collaboration/conversation, to connect people in multiple geographic locations, to do video conferencing for business meetings, and to share documents when doing any collaboration. You also have a change window to share additional comments. It allows large meetings to occur across different rooms if required."
"I think GoToMeeting is perfectly suited for large teams that need to be able to have a consistent forum to offer to clients to connect. With the flexibility to record and screen-share, it makes life so much easier for CS teams that work with clients on a regular daily basis. It is the perfect easy-to-use solution to connect with clients and be able to provide a robust experience to your audience outside of a regular phone call."
"GoToMeeting is, in my experience, best used when we have to share our work with someone else. We can easily share our screen to show how the work is being done, or if we need to know anything, we can let anyone in the conference be a presenter and play his part."
"I can't think of many scenarios where it would be inappropriate. I have used it for board meetings, end-user training sessions, recordings so future staff can reference it for learning, and I'm sure I'm missing others. On the fly, meetings are pretty simple, so you can share screens and troubleshoot problems."
"GoToMeeting is a great tool.  It can also be suitable for meetings with partners or customers that you are trying to show your products or walk through a contract or proposal.  Not sure it's beneficial for just a conference call, especially with how cell phones can accommodate multiple people these days, but if you need to see the same thing or each other, this is perfect."
"GoToMeeting is well suited for growing companies that need a tool to showcase their software platform. Whether it's inside sales, outside sales, or customer success, it's a quality product to use. Also for those logging in its web-based capabilities are great for clients on the go. Overall great sales product. I can't speak to how it's used by operations as much, I would assume for group meetings."
GoToMeeting is terrific software for remote meetings or presentations.
"It definitely gets the job done, but honestly our clients aren't big fans of GTM due to how agressively GTM pushes people to download the application instead of just using a web browser version. Our internal team likes it and has found it easy to hop into rooms and talk with one another about projects."
My organization really likes GoToMeeting. Our sales team gives a lot of sales presentations through the software and they comment on how 99% of the companies they are presenting to are already familiar with the look and feel of GoToMeeting. We have found the app to work really well on mobile as well.
"GoToMeeting offers flexibility in video conferencing, where each person can share their work and take control of the presentation. It offers good functionality for collaboration on projects that require several individuals to handle different pieces of the project and then come together, share their work and make modifications in the moment."
"GoToMeeting is well suited to anyone needing to use collaboration between companies, companies and vendors, companies and customers, etc.  This really is meant for B2B type setups, technical training, quarterly meetings, etc. I do not recommend this as a replacement for an in-house instant messaging/collaboration platform (Skype for Business or Slack). Even with AD integration, the product doesn't stack up against the other two. I like the fact that the product sticks to what it's good at and doesn't try to be everything to everyone."
"When the need is to see others' screens or show your screen, GoToMeeting is perfectly suited. Screenshots and walkthroughs are just not enough, being able to show exactly what is happening is the real need that GoToMeeting fulfills. That's where GoToMeeting shines.When just doing a conference call without a screen-share, it's not as appropriate, as most people would need to download the application to use it."
"GoTo meeting was well suited for screen sharing and audio conversation.  The video chat issue was really a problem.  If too many of us in the office would try to show our faces on screen during the same meeting, it would severely lag and we would have issues seeing each other."
"GoToMeeting gives users the ability to bring people together from anywhere into a single environment. By being able to screen share and pass off presenter responsibilities, it has the potential to be very interactive and productive. Sometimes, more productive than actually being in the same room at the same time."
"Finalizing project details is where GoToMeeting really shines and is the most beneficial for our usage. Allowing us to have frequent meetings, putting them together (even at the last minute) and working out details between ourselves and a client is a huge time saver. Where it isn't as useful (and this isn't a ""flaw"" of GoToMeeting but when working to land a new client, in person meetings tend to show a higher rate of securing the project than online meetings. Once that personal link is established then GoToMeeting is great."
"I like GoToMeeting for video conferencing and conference calls.  I like it for screen sharing as well, but not necessarily collaboration.  I think it works really well within an organization with multiple offices or job sites and if set-up well, video conferencing in these instances is particularly easy.  Getting video conferencing from external users has been a challenge, and most just call in, even though there are digital audio and video obviously available.  This may be a simple end-user preference on their end, however.  We just really find that internal meetings where we can look face to face with folks in another location make working together much more smooth. "
"GoToMeeting is great if you have a large team, and you’re always needing to be in touch.

It offers good functionality for collaboration on projects that require several individuals to handle different pieces of the project and then come together, share their work and make modifications in the moment."
"GoToMeeting is well suited to anyone needing to use collaboration between companies, companies and vendors, companies and customers, etc.  This really is meant for B2B type setups, technical training, quarterly meetings, etc. I do not recommend this as a replacement for an in-house instant messaging/collaboration platform (Skype for Business or Slack). Even with AD integration, the product doesn't stack up against the other two. I like the fact that the product sticks to what it's good at and doesn't try to be everything to everyone."
"When the need is to see others' screens or show your screen, GoToMeeting is perfectly suited. Screenshots and walkthroughs are just not enough, being able to show exactly what is happening is the real need that GoToMeeting fulfills. That's where GoToMeeting shines.When just doing a conference call without a screen-share, it's not as appropriate, as most people would need to download the application to use it."
"GoTo meeting was well suited for screen sharing and audio conversation.  The video chat issue was really a problem.  If too many of us in the office would try to show our faces on screen during the same meeting, it would severely lag and we would have issues seeing each other."
"GoToMeeting gives users the ability to bring people together from anywhere into a single environment. By being able to screen share and pass off presenter responsibilities, it has the potential to be very interactive and productive. Sometimes, more productive than actually being in the same room at the same time."
"Finalizing project details is where GoToMeeting really shines and is the most beneficial for our usage. Allowing us to have frequent meetings, putting them together (even at the last minute) and working out details between ourselves and a client is a huge time saver. Where it isn't as useful (and this isn't a ""flaw"" of GoToMeeting but when working to land a new client, in person meetings tend to show a higher rate of securing the project than online meetings. Once that personal link is established then GoToMeeting is great."
"I like GoToMeeting for video conferencing and conference calls.  I like it for screen sharing as well, but not necessarily collaboration.  I think it works really well within an organization with multiple offices or job sites and if set-up well, video conferencing in these instances is particularly easy.  Getting video conferencing from external users has been a challenge, and most just call in, even though there are digital audio and video obviously available.  This may be a simple end-user preference on their end, however.  We just really find that internal meetings where we can look face to face with folks in another location make working together much more smooth. "
"GoToMeeting is great if you have a large team, and you’re always needing to be in touch. If you don’t speak to clients on a daily basis, either that’s biweekly or monthly, then GoToMeeting sounds too expensive. If you do not need to use such a quality service, then chances are you will find a more affordable outlet online. "
"All in all, GoToMeeting is a promising remote meeting software due to its limitless features and functionalities.  It is a good software for attending the webinars and conducting online tutorials and teaching.  As a teacher using it, this is so far one of the best pieces of software I've used because the video and audio are clear enough that all attendees understand easily."
"On-demand or scheduled meetings where participants need to screen share and collaborate, showing design files, project plans, reports, etc.Video conferencing, including use in job interviews, team meetings, and client presentations."
"In some instances, GoToMeeting is harder to use than alternatives such as Zoom or BlueJeans in terms of video experience and in some instances is more complex than using Skype for example. At times the mobile app is inflexible when trying to switch from mobile to an internet connection in particular when entering the pin code, which is very tricky when on the move."
"If adopted by an entire department or user group, it works well as support, and training for the entire group is efficient.  If you have meetings with a mixture of technologies joining the meeting (phone, computer audio with video, computer with phone) GoToMeeting bridges seamlessly.  Video quality is excellent, users are very impressed with the jump up in quality form free platforms (Skype, Google Chat, etc)."
"GoToMeeting is suitable for users that want the option to meet with clients or customers without having to meet in person. As a large software company, we aren't in the same city, let alone the same state as most of our customers so it's important for us to have a platform that can allow for more personalized, one on one meetings. If you are working locally and often want to meet with clients in person, this software is not a good fit. There wouldn't be a purpose to it."
"My main issue with GoToMeeting is the lack of reliability. A lot of their features are really nice, especially on the recording side. The problem is that none of those features matter if the core of the product, the meeting itself, is having issues. If my audio is delayed by a couple of seconds it leads to a lot of awkward silences and people accidentally interrupting each other. When I'm setting up a meeting in a conference room, I should just be able to come in and click a button to get going."
"GoToMeeting is a great option for having to meet with clients or to show them your screen. Since end-users are not forced to download a client and can join from any web browser, it works well for inviting customers in secure locations or who don't have the rights to download applications to their computer. It does an alright job for supporting customers, but there are better options to control the customer's computer from afar."
"I highly recommend GoToMeeting. It's a great tool for meetings, webinars, training, etc. I think it's great that people in different locations can still collaborate and hold meetings, whether just audio with slides, or face-time like meetings. Given the current events with COVID-19, it's especially important to be able to have these interactions without actually coming into contact with someone."
"GoToMeeting is well suited if you need to record a screen-share session or collaboration/conversation, to connect people in multiple geographic locations, to do video conferencing for business meetings, and to share documents when doing any collaboration. You also have a change window to share additional comments. It allows large meetings to occur across different rooms if required."
"I think GoToMeeting is perfectly suited for large teams that need to be able to have a consistent forum to offer to clients to connect. With the flexibility to record and screen-share, it makes life so much easier for CS teams that work with clients on a regular daily basis. It is the perfect easy-to-use solution to connect with clients and be able to provide a robust experience to your audience outside of a regular phone call."
"GoToMeeting is, in my experience, best used when we have to share our work with someone else. We can easily share our screen to show how the work is being done, or if we need to know anything, we can let anyone in the conference be a presenter and play his part."
"I can't think of many scenarios where it would be inappropriate. I have used it for board meetings, end-user training sessions, recordings so future staff can reference it for learning, and I'm sure I'm missing others. On the fly, meetings are pretty simple, so you can share screens and troubleshoot problems."
"GoToMeeting is a great tool.  It can also be suitable for meetings with partners or customers that you are trying to show your products or walk through a contract or proposal.  Not sure it's beneficial for just a conference call, especially with how cell phones can accommodate multiple people these days, but if you need to see the same thing or each other, this is perfect."
"GoToMeeting is well suited for growing companies that need a tool to showcase their software platform. Whether it's inside sales, outside sales, or customer success, it's a quality product to use. Also for those logging in its web-based capabilities are great for clients on the go. Overall great sales product. I can't speak to how it's used by operations as much, I would assume for group meetings."
GoToMeeting is terrific software for remote meetings or presentations.
"It definitely gets the job done, but honestly our clients aren't big fans of GTM due to how agressively GTM pushes people to download the application instead of just using a web browser version. Our internal team likes it and has found it easy to hop into rooms and talk with one another about projects."
My organization really likes GoToMeeting. Our sales team gives a lot of sales presentations through the software and they comment on how 99% of the companies they are presenting to are already familiar with the look and feel of GoToMeeting. We have found the app to work really well on mobile as well.

"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes."
"For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls."
"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool."
"Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere."
Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.
This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. "
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc."
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person."
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before."
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. 
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things."
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection."
"I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype."
"Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool."
Zoom makes it easy to generate meetings and send them to parties.
We used Zoom for conferencing with our teams while working on outages or maintenance windows.
"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate. That being said, Zoom is best suited for organizations that appreciate video capabilities for their meetings."
Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.

"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool."
"Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere."
Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.
This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. "
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc."
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person."
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before."
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. 
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things."
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection."
"I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype."
"Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool."
Zoom makes it easy to generate meetings and send them to parties.
We used Zoom for conferencing with our teams while working on outages or maintenance windows.
"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate. That being said, Zoom is best suited for organizations that appreciate video capabilities for their meetings."
Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.
"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes."

Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things."
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection."
"I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype."
"Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool."
Zoom makes it easy to generate meetings and send them to parties.
We used Zoom for conferencing with our teams while working on outages or maintenance windows.
"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate. That being said, Zoom is best suited for organizations that appreciate video capabilities for their meetings."
Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.
"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes."
"For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls."
"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool."
"Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere."
Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.
This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. "
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc."
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person."
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before."

Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes."
"For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls."
"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool."
"Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere."
Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.
This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. "
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.
"Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc."
"Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person."
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before."
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. 
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things."
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection."
"I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype."
"Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool."
Zoom makes it easy to generate meetings and send them to parties.
We used Zoom for conferencing with our teams while working on outages or maintenance windows.
"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate. That being said, Zoom is best suited for organizations that appreciate video capabilities for their meetings."

Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person."
"Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before."
I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction. 
Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.
I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.
Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.
"Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things."
"Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection."
"I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype."
"Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool."
Zoom makes it easy to generate meetings and send them to parties.
We used Zoom for conferencing with our teams while working on outages or maintenance windows.
"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate. That being said, Zoom is best suited for organizations that appreciate video capabilities for their meetings."
Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.
"Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes."
"For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls."
"Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool."
"Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere."
Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.
This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.
"Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. "
Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.

"Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level.
