I admit I'm a new user of the app, however I found I had accidentally engaged an annotation feature when trying to unmute (I guess buttons overlay slightly or something?). Pressing back in android *did not* simply return you to your active meeting but rather to app settings it seems like. Worse yet, pressing back button from this screen rather than returning you to your active meeting dumps you to home screen (not hanging up thankfully) rather than sending you back to your active meeting. To me this is rather insane. I had legitimate issues getting myself unmuted in time for my turn in my meeting. Eventually after I ran some where else to offer my thoughts, walking back I found that there was a return to meeting button on the primary screen of settings, but the back button functionality is extremely poorly thought out."""

However this did not happen on my device. So I ended up with audio coming from headphones and speaker. No volume controls worked and I've no idea whether the headphone or device mic was used.

4910,"""I've used this software for long and it's very good. I've used it often in school. Very easy to use, and you just need a google account to log in. Awesome and I can really recommend it! 7/10"""
4911,Our overall experience with Google classroom is favorable.  We have used it in conjunction with our 1:1 technology initiative with student issued Chromebooks.  We have no plans to switch products at this time
4912,"""I really enjoy using Google Classroom to get information out to my students quickly.  It is my Homebase for all of my websites, information, assessments, files, you name it.  My students know to go there for links to everything."""
4913,"""Overall, Google classroom works nicely as a supplemental classroom tool for digital work. It gets the job done even if it lacks a few small features. I plan to continue using it whether those features are added or not due to the ease of setup and management for teachers and students. """

4915,AMAZING. Very user friendly/ kid friendly. Very aesthetically pleasing and not overwhelming!

4917,Google Classroom was very useful to me as a college student that depends on out of class work and studying. So this app was overall amazing.
4918,"""Google Classroom has become an essential part of my graduation. The ease and speed with which teachers can post assignments, reading materials and classes, in addition to the interaction between students and teachers, make Google Classroom a great ally of our studies, and its relevance is even more evident in these times of social detachment and quarantine."""
4919,"""My overall experience has been very positive.  It's made facilitating classes much easier, and has allowed students to do more work when it's the best timing for them.  In our specialized school we deal with a lot of absenteeism, and Classroom helps to manage that issue much better than what I was using before."""
4920,Google Classroom is a wonderful way to distribute writing assignments to my whole class and comes complete with spell check to make the editing process all the easier for my learning writers. I express particular gratitude for the speech-to-text feature that I know I will be using for a long time to come.
4921,"""I have been using Google Classroom in my middle and high school classrooms since its early beta stage.  I can tell you with 6 different preps in a school day, this is a great way to keep myself and my students organized and on task."""
4922,"""Overall, I have found that this software has absolutely changed the way I teach.  I am able with the click of a button to send my students assignments, video links, study guides, and other resources essential for their learning.  It also makes it easier for parents to interact with their child's education and puts them in more of a position of power to help."""
4923,"""My overall experience with Google Classroom has been extremely rewarding. I have saved so much time, paper, and energy which allows me to improve the quality of my assignments and teaching while I can interact with students in real time, monitor their work, and quickly see who has submitted work. I love that it is accessible on any device and it makes my job so much easier. I love that it has decreased paper wastage immensely and I would highly encourage teachers to utilize Google Classroom as it is certainly a game changer."""
4924,"""Google Classroom is a must for any classroom with the technology to support it. Its easy implementation and connection to so many other tools, this will be a hub for your students and create an easy structure for your class - not to mention it is free AND a green solution!"""
4925,"""Overall, I find Google classroom extremely user-friendly for all ages and levels of experience. It is very easy to upload assignments and documents. The fact that it is compatible with so many other websites makes it a huge plus in my book. If it would just add a few more customization tools, it would be the perfect platform to utilize within the classroom or through distance learning. """
4926,"""As a student, it's really hard to create better self management when it comes to managing the whole bunch of stuff especially with so many academic lessons and task you have (depends on where you live in as different country has different education policy and curriculum) and this app will take care the mess so you can check what are the things must be done and get reminded of the upcoming task. In my country where i live in, sometimes most teacher skip the class which mean teaching learning process will be postpone, but this app will let you learn wherever you are using online teaching feature, no excuse for not studying!"""
4927,"""Overall, I love the experience with Google Classroom. It enhances my ability to learn in and out of class ten-fold. If I were to ever become a teacher, I would definitely use Google Classroom as my way of communicating to my students."""
4928,"""Overall, my experience has been very positive. It allows me and my students to stay organized. It holds students accountable for knowing what is expected of them and following up if they are absent. It also helps me stay organized as a leader with other teachers. It keeps all of our resources/activities organized nicely and we can access it anywhere anytime. """
4929,"""My overall experience with Google Classroom, I would say, has been more positive than negative. Although, the program does have some limitations, the positive aspects of this software outweigh their opposite counterparts. From its ease of use to its versatility, I would definitely rate this program as a beneficial one, that without a doubt has helped the organization of my academic career."""
4930,Since having to do all classes online due to the COVID-19 Pandemic I can honestly say that google classroom has saved the day! This has made life so much easier and it is an amazingly wonderful tool for educators and students alike!
4931,"""I love this cloud-based paperless option for daily student work. Easy to share, collaborate and manage."""
4932,"""My overall experience with Google Classroom has been great and compared to many of the other platforms that I have used in the past, I think this one is absolutely amazing. In terms of a clean interface with simplicity in being able to use, nothing beats Google Classroom! Therefore, I would highly reccomend for anyone looking to use this actually give it a try because it can be really convenient and make things easier!"""
4933,Overall I really like this program and would recommend it to teachers and tutors. It really makes our jobs easier. Not to mention since everything can be made and submitted online it is a lot better from the environment and cuts down way fewer trees. I got introduced to this software in High School and decided to use it for my part-time tutoring business ever since. Google Classroom is far superior to the other programs I have come across such as Moodle. I would say I give this program an 8/10.
4934,"""It's been extremely positive.  Teachers can upload a single document from google drive and decide whether they want students to each receive their own editable copy, how they want it turned in and how/if students can collaborate with each other. It's very easy to use.  """
4935,Google Classroom is a great way for educators to assign work for students and share extra tools which would be helpful for students themselves. It reminds students when assignments are due and they can actively participate in discussions within the software itself.
4936,#NAME?
4937,"""In my overall experience, Google Classroom is by a wide margin the best cloud-based conveyance framework I have ever utilized. Homeroom makes allotting notes, work and tests extremely simple. I especially appreciate the way that you can make a Google Form Quiz legitimately from the Classroom task button. Particularly noteworthy is the manner by which oneself stamping highlights in Google Forms can be straightforwardly brought into Google Classroom. Definitely I suggest all the educator to use it and implement the knowledge of technology for betterment of students. Google Classroom is one of the best ways for classroom management. Students  also love to study and get feedback through Google Classroom."""
4938,"""I use Google Classroom every day to engage with the students in my classes. I put all information, handouts, and reading source on the platform, making it easy for the students to get them. I also use Google Classroom to set up assignment, making it easy for the students to upload their papers and easy for me to mark their works."""
4939,"""No problems with it at all!  Works very well for schools! If the App ads more features that would be cool, but its great just the way it is! Very easy to use!"""
4940,I have had success using Google Classroom on a daily basis with my students both in school and during remote learning. Using Google Classroom has simplified sharing daily assignments with my students.
4941,It allowed me to continue my studies and graduate in the midst of a serious political crisis.
4942,I have realised that google classroom is a great software for both teachers and students because it makes their lives so much easier by making them be able to have a ''virtual classroom'' where they can keep track of all their assignments etc.
4943,"""I had a really good time using Google Classroom as a teacher and I would love to switch to it when possible. Google has always been known for its great Cloud-based service and productivity suites and this software is no different. If you're looking for a good LMS, this is it."""
4944,The benefits of Google Classroom is that it allows me to setup different classes and keep them all in one place.
4945,"""Overall, I am satisfied by product for basic courses, as a depository of curriculum, and a way for students to interact with each other and teacher."""
4946,I don't even remember what life was like before Google Classroom.  I use this resource so often to help keep my students informed of what's happening in the classroom.  This is one of the best tools to utilize to help students who are absent not fall behind when they miss school.  It's a fabulous resource that provides a wide range of uses for any classroom.
4947,"""I have been using Google Classroom more than some of my colleagues. And, during this unprecedented time of COVID-19 quarantine and distance learning, Google Classroom has been the saving grace of our school. All teachers in our building easily learned how to create classes and use it within less than 24 hours. Parents are loving having access to lessons online through Google Classroom. """
4948,Google Classroom has been a very simple to use and low-cost (free!) solution for delivering my course content. It is easy to get students started and many of them are already familiar with the G Suite productivity tools so the barrier to interaction is quite low.
4949,Google classroom is a great digital resource when it comes to pushing out assignments to your students.  It is easy to use for a teacher and the students as well.
4950,"""I can say Google Classroom is positive considering the overall benefits. Although the academic environment is not here, the technical advantages have inspired me and accelerated my work. Now is the age of technology. So distance learning activities directly through the Google Classroom is one of Google's best innovations. And the main advantage of this is that I can use it for free."""
4951,"""Students can find absolutely everything they need in the Classroom. As long as they have an internet connection, they can access my Classroom from anywhere. Lost worksheets, forgotten instructions, reviews for tests, and much more are all at the ready. This has erased the need for repeated/redundant efforts on my part! This has saved so much time and frustration! Students are more successful because they have a backup resource at their fingertips. It also helps with parent involvement."""
4952,Connecting students and teachers is really good start by such Google product. I can hope that over the time Google people will be gradually adding awesome features in this product and they should keep space for another players also in their echo system.  I am overall happy with Google classroom
4953,I have used Google Classroom as a teacher with students and also as an Instructional Technologist teaching teachers. It is still my favorite LMS option.
4954,"""Overall, I really love using google classroom. It has made my teaching experience a lot easier than it was when I only used hard copies of every assignment and had to keep individual folders for each students work. """
4955,"""I used it as a teacher with my middle school students. I don't see it working for preschool or elementary, unless you add the parents as students as well. Parents need to create a Google account to be able to access the information from the newsletter/summary they get. Students don't really get a grade book, but they can see grades for each assignment. Needs a lot of work still. """
5100,"""I use a variety of collaboration tools, but my regular go-to tool is meet.google.com. Also, since Google upgraded Hangouts to add a phone number option, it's become a possible to use with everyone, regardless of someone's firewall settings."""
5101,"""Overall I loved using google hangouts! It's clean, fast, responsive, good quality video and audio calls and my students love it. Seeing both email and chat's also in Gmail has also been a cool feature just another part of the synchronicity. A great product that is available for free and a product that should be used by everyone."""
5102,"""Using Google Hangouts Meet software I am able to stay connected with my employees and my business partner when working remotely. So, my website content, products inventory and customer complaints continue to be addressed while I am not physically present in my brick and mortar apparel store. The best part is the fact that I don't have to pay a subscription fees or maintenance fees. Hence, my ROI is high. If I face any issues with the software, I am able to find plenty of support in Google portal and other blogs. """
5103,"""My usage of it is to simply connect with the client, conduct a consult with a potential client. It accomplishes those tasks for me easily. """
5104,"""Every app which is connected to google is distinguished with it's UI/UX, it is comfortable for using and easier to explain to other people how to use it. You can make a call for large group of people and experience will just get better and better."""
5105,"""Good video conferencing tool that allows you to connect with relative ease to others with Google accounts simply and fast. Wish it still had options to share files etc or share screen. A little bit too basic for my liking, especially when you are already connected to the suite."""
5106,Since I tend to use a lot of google products it made sense to use Google hangouts for chats. I also wanted a way to receive and send text messages from my computer if I wasn't using a mac's imessage.
5107,"""Reliable calls, great quality video & audio, and the built in chat + presentation options are great."""
5108,Amazing quality with such an ease to connect friends and family.
5109,"""I've made a few tries with this software and still trying it out, and testing its pros and cons. """
5110,"""Google Meet has become a daily tool in my life since the adoption of distance learning at my university. It is very easy and quick to get used to it, but some technical problems can make your experience less fluid and a little irritating at times. Overall, it is a reliable, competent program, but it can improve in some aspects."""
5111,"""Overall, this app is useful. That's why I use it daily.  I have a Google Pixel 2, so it's easy to use Google apps."""
5112,Overall love Hangouts.
5113,Basically what we were looking for was a conferencing solution that was free and reliable. Working and presentations directly from home was also a big consideration. Hangouts successfully filled that space and has presented  no reason to switch
5114,"""I love this software! I really do. I use it as the team chat in my organization. For simple communications and messages this is my to-go software. It's instantaneous, and since it's an extension from Google, the messages can be received either through the computer or the cellphone. In addition, the video conferencing and share screen options are awesome! It's been proved to be very helpful to me when I want to discuss about something with somebody who is not physically present. I use this software for work only to avoid confusions with personal communications. """
5115,"""I've used Google Hangouts predecessor, Google Voice, since it came out. I even used it with Sprint when they partnered automatic voice forwarding and using your Sprint number on Google Voice (circa ~2010). Back then, I'd often use my HP laptop's microphone array and speakers covering the width of the device to use the speakerphone. Better quality on my laptop speakerphone setup with Google Voice (later Hangouts) than directly on a phone. Google Hangout's voice quality has always been exceptionally clear and steady. No perceptible delays, no stuttering, and it sounds high bitrate.  Google Hangouts continues to provide cheap international phone calls through any of their interfaces. Also, enabled me to call over any Wi-Fi enabled device for cheaper calling when traveling outside USA.  I often use a bluetooth headset with my computer, alternate regularly between Android + iOS devices (often carrying two simultaneously), while always maintaining Google Hangouts in the background and the same number across all devices. In recent years, Google Hangouts allowed me to login to multiple phone accounts in a single device.  In addition to voice, Google Hangouts in recent years began supporting text and media messages through their desktop and mobile app making it seamless to start a conversation on one device then move to a more efficient device without waiting for a synchronization. Its become a complete cell phone replacement without the need to stay connected to one wireless carrier."""
5116,"""Very satisfied! This allows me to stay up to date with colleagues and stay on the same page regarding projects and tasks. We tried other platforms, but given Hangouts integration with G Suite, this is hands down the best option."""
5117,"""Super happy with this product, glad to have made the switch and have no intention of switching to anything else anytime. (Though I do wish I could record meetings...)"""
5118,Overall Google Hangouts provides us with good chatting functionality within our institute. End users find it extremely easy to use and enjoy seeing their email and chats in the same window.
5119,Over 2 years I have been using google hangouts and my experience was very positive. It's one of the most famous and incredible applications available for communication. Application is very light and it loads really fast. For me it's a great tool for video conferencing and collaboration. I think it is a good invesment for any business.
5120,"""I am using Google Hangout tool at work to conduct conferencing calls with web developers so I can explain tagging requirements and strategy for new web pages, sites or applications. I also use it to do vendor presentations on how a particular media campaign performed. Overall my experience has been smooth as long as I am running one conferencing session and have closed all previous sessions. If I am calling using the random conference number and have muted the Hangout session while sharing my screen, it works fine. """
5121,I love Google Hangouts! It's how my team connects on a daily basis and is so easy to access and utilize. It's super user friendly and very streamlined.
5122,"""conversations on google hangout cannot be deleted or edited, that makes it to serve has a good record keeping platform for my organisation, in case i forget my past conversation i can search them out. Hangout has helped my organisation to save cost sourcing for other messaging platforms and i prefer it for instant messaging."""
5123,We have been able to use Google Hangouts to quickly and easily communicate across departments and locations for simple and easy exchange of information.
5124,"""I use Hangouts to contact potential clients. I like not having to share my phone number from good to first, I think it's important to keep my personal data protected. I prefer that my clients contact me by email or social networks before sharing my phone number. I also made videoconferences in which the shared screen is one of the tools I use the most. Although it seems incredible, I really like that Hangouts does not notify if the other person saw or did not see the messages, because I think it's an unnecessary functionality. Today we can see a message and not respond immediately because we are busy and for no other reason. But sometimes it's misinterpreted. This is one of the reasons why I like hangouts more than other messaging platforms."""
5125,"""Google Hangouts helped me and continues to help me with my business to connect with my clients and colleagues, although it has many things that can be improved, it has everything necessary to communicate in addition, free of charge, unlimited and without the need to use other applications, much less install anything . It is a very good solution especially if you are a user of the entire Google ecosystem since, as expected, its integration is excellent."""
5126,Without Google Hangouts I wouldn't have been able to successfully complete my tasks and responsibilities while working from home remotely. I highly recommend this tool for small companies that want to allow their employees the ability to telecommute.
5127,"""Hangout has helped my organization reduce spending on a previous collaboration software we hitherto used. I personally prefer hangout for my instant messaging activities. Not only is the software smooth and lightweight, but it is also very easy to use as well as been quick and unproblematic. It is the epitome of messaging convenience for me."""
5128,"""Our company has a very flexible work-from-home policy, which means that most of our meetings occur with someone joining via Hangouts. It's usually a very good experience, we share screen and work very much like we were sitting side by side. It's especially useful for working on a shared Google document, both reading and editing at the same time. We also use it with clients, who are increasingly adopting Google suite as their corporative tool for emails and documents. We've grown so used to this way of remote collaborations that we cringe when asked to use Skype and get office documents attached to emails.   I would definitely recommend Hangouts as a great tool for video meeting and collaboration, however I cannot vouch for it's performance with large quantity of attendants, we usually have no more than two or three people connecting remotely to Hangouts.  """
5129,"""Hangouts definitely has a lot of potential and the fact it can be downloaded on your phone is amazing because a lot of people have issues sending texts between Apple and Android devices. Perhaps, instead of having the hangouts extension open up a mini tab for hangouts, have it take you to the old official site instead? I liked the old site a lot better than the extension window that pops up. Overall, Hangouts is a great communications tool and should be used more than it is by the common person. Highly underrated. """
5130,"""Integration is the key selling point for using Hangouts. I like that I can access it from anywhere, can talk to people seamlessly through multiple devices, and have search features at my disposal. Having the option to video chat and send multi-media messages is also nice (yay GIFs!). I have definitely told people they need to use it, especially if they have a gmail address. Overall, the good outweighs the bad and I think the bad is sure to be fixed."""
5131,"""Google knows best. So it's killing* (arguably) a good service. I like Hangouts. I use it every day many times a day.  My work messages come through hangouts. My personal messages come through hangsouts. They are on my phone, my tablet, my car, my computer. They are with me. Text? When my phone service is spotty, I don't get texts..... but I might have wifi. And my wifi get's hangouts!  So, it's great, and it's going away in 2019(ish)"""
5132,"""Hangouts gives a fast and efficient communication setup for its users, allowing them to contact clients, coworkers, and friends easily and efficiently, with very few drawbacks. It is one of my primary communication tools with coworkers, and I will probably keep using it as such for long into the future."""
5133,"""The truth is that I have used many instant messaging tools, and this in particular is my favorite. I think it is very flexible and very well thought out for corporate environments where they can all be communicated in addition to the google suite.  My experience with this multiplatform solution has been very good, particularly my agenda is always full of meetings and in most of the time I have some document to present, and what gives me more value is that you can archive the conversations and calls to keep them synchronized on the cloud.  I recommend it to all users who wish to have communication under a platform that innovates every day."""
5134,"""An efficient software, easy to use, with a very nice and effective interface. These are the ideas that come to mind at the time of qualifying this incredible software that has facilitated in a considerable way my labor and professional development. """
5135,Hangouts for me is essential in day to day
5136,"""It keeps me in touch with anybody, anywhere, running just as well on iOS as it does on Android and in the web browser. If I need to access information that was previously discussed, I can review and search through conversations dating back nearly a decade."""
5137,"""While Hangouts was groundbreaking software, its impending discontinuation makes it hard to recommend."""
5138,It's an amazing tool that meets the needs of organization and individuals by securing the messages sent through an end to end encryption to secure privacy.
5139,as i said its have a lot of features should be add in next generation of the app i liked so much if its add notifications on that
5140,I found it one of the easier ways to make free wifi calls at the begining of the wifi calling era.   They haven't adjusted with the times. I had hoped that Hangouts had been more secure for the users not just gathering data for the Google Machine.  Which is already run by AI....just kidding. I have to be right...
5141,Overall I have had a very positive experience using Hangouts. It's wonderful as an individual and works perfectly for my business as well. I need to be able to have private chats with clients and this makes it easy to stay connected without providing my personal phone number.
5142,"""Currently we use this tool in my company through a multiple conversation of 28 participants across the country, in which we all put monitoring information at the moment of the news events that occur in each city.  All this information is analyzed and reports prepared for the managers and executives of the organization. """
5143,"""Hangouts is an excellent software, because it is much easier to use than other software that provide the same service, as it has many interesting options that can be complemented with communications between two or more people.   I recommend this software to all those who require a good tool to communicate between two or more people. """
5144,"""It makes meeting easier. Especially when it comes to vendor partners that are out of state, it makes it easy to connect face-to-face instead of on a call. Additionally audio is sooooo much crisper. I don't have the issues I typically do on phone calls saying """"Hey, I missed that. Can you repeat yourself?"""" over and over and over again."""
5145,"""Overall, Hangouts was the program for us. Rival video chat and stream software used too much bandwidth or lacked the quality that Hangouts produced. """
5146,We have been using Google Hangouts to have online meetings with members that are all over Australia and NZ. This has been an excellent tool to have meetings and keep the socialness on point. I think it is better to see the people you are speaking to than just listen to their voices. I will keep using this for work and for personal use.
5288,"""I have offices, customers, account managers, partners and even developers in severalc countries. With this solution I can keep meetings or presentations everywhere in the World where I have Internet connection. The sound can be by Internet or phone call, I can share my screen ot my webcam, and aldo I can save the meeting, to keep track of it."""
5289,"""GoToMeeting is an effective platform for most business needs. Just be sure that you do not require any unique support needs, or if you do that you have the time to wait and deal with the technician tango that companies like this do."""
5290,"""This software works. The mobile apps run great and won't dissapoint. The addins to install on PC and Mac are lighweight and install very quickly and it still leads when connecting to different IT environments (we have never experienced having issues with a customer when using GoTo Meeting in their network), something that some remote meeting softwares haven't been able to achieve."""
5291,Very useful for conducting the live meetings with the screen sharing!
5292,GoTo is very integral to my work since I oversee a number of software projects and I need to ensure the stakeholders and colleagues are roped in quickly to address issues that may arise.  I enjoy the ease of use.  I just hope they stabilize audio connectivity.
5293,GotoMeeting has been the premier corporate web chat service for a long time. They have decent customer support and respond to you within a day or so. Not bad at all.
5294,"""I had daily meeting with my teams in latin america. Either scheduled or on  the rush, GTM never failed as the preferred tool among the C suite"""
5295,We have relished a lot from time saving to keeping social distancing while undertaking conferences.
5296,I was able to connect with more those that didn't know how to video/audio conference from their computers and needed to use a conference bridge phone number.
5297,"""We use slack for most of our intracompany communication, but GoToMeeting is what we use for all voice or video telecons with external parties."""
5298,"""Overall this is an indispensable tool for me despite the bugs that might pop up, or because it makes it easier to conference with team members who are not able to be present at my meetings. It is also very helpful to attend a meeting when I am not able to attend in person, such as when I am sick but can not afford to miss out on a critical meeting. """
5299,"""Overall it does exactly what I need it to do, but Iâ€™m really comparing it to WebEx. With WebEx, I could record meetings, create meetings through Outlook, and it had SSO enabled. GoToMeeting seems like a step backwards, but it still gets the job done. Just a little more tedious in my opinion."""
5300,"""The overall experience is really good; GTM runs flawlessly every time and it is full of options. The main con is just related to its price. However if you or your company can afford it, it is a really good option as a meeting software."""
5301,"""In general I've a really good experience with GTM, the video/audio quality is remarkable, and the usability is excelent. In my humble opinion, is one of the best meeting software I've ever used."""
5302,"""I love using GoToMeeting for my team meetings. It's reliable and easy to use. We have tested out other meeting solutions including Zoom, but none compare to the ease of use found with GTM. Zoom meetings, for instance, have a much different interface, and very little is intuitive about the dashboard. Conversely, GoToMeeting's dashboard is easy to understand and follow. You can also easily change your user name within a meeting, so if you are on an informal meeting with team members you might just list your first name, whereas for a client meeting you can list your full name, title, etc."""
5303,"""Being able to communicate with other people in my company and the ability to have it recorded, with being able to go back and see who said what and who was suppose to do what.  Just the time of not needing to take notes is wonderful. Now I just print them out and highlight the important stuff.  GoToMeetings has made my business look larger than it is when I speak with very large companies. When I set up a GoToMeeting with them they are very impressed. It also gives me the opportunity to demonstrate our products. It's so much better than having them go to YouTube to watch a video. At GoToMeeting I demonstrate and then they can ask questions there """"real time."""" If they want me to change a parameter, I can do that, right then, """"real time.""""  So my experience over all is wonderful."""
5304,I use this software almost on a daily basis to communicate with team members that are not situated in the same geographical location. It is the company wide go to software for all and it does make connecting with virtual teams much simpler. I think there is something for everyone in this software and it will only get better with time.
5305,"""I love GoToMeeting (GTM)! I teach online and hold live chats sometimes 3 nights a week. I have to sometimes use another program, and at times when it doesnâ€™t work I have quickly jusmped on GTM and it â€˜saves the dayâ€� every time! I love the new TRANSCRIPTION feature too! And so do my students. Granted it isnâ€™t perfect, but what speech-to-text feature is?  I make sure to use GTM and introduce it to my students at least once per course. The following week I will switch back to the other program, and then I let my students vote on which program theyâ€™d prefer to use the following week â€“ GTM wins every time! I have used other online VOI chat tools, but they seem to keep changing?! They """"think"""" they're making improvements, but take away such a valuable feature as being able to share the moderator's entire screen?! Why?! Either that or their newer version cannot â€œhandleâ€� sharing the entire screen and errors out showing the same screen over and over again in a trail of overlapping screens that run off into infinity. GTM is just easier to use! Inviting attendees is even easy â€“ just set up a future meeting and the email invitation is created for you! Easy peasy!   I just took a another look at it again and played around with resizing and moving the feature windows and I even found something else about it that I didn't know before...so now I love it even more!"""
5306,"""I think it's a great essential service to all companies for smooth and fast communication, especially when staff are over the place in different cities, so having this service helps bring everyone together despite the distances."""
5307,"""Overall experience is nice, it helps in delivering work and makes it look so easy to manage the work with the best communication medium. It has got great customer support too with great privacy and even cost efficient. Best in business, delivers what it promises."""
5308,"""We love GoToMeeting because it's mostly simple and straightforward.  Support for the product is great.  Every issue we had was answered within minutes of our call.  The pricing is adequate considering how many participants you can have on each meeting.  Overall, I recommend GoToMeeting as gold standard right up there with WebEx and JoinMe.  GoToMeeting is in my opinion more reliable and has easier setup."""
5309,Over it work great and been the bone for our dIaily meetings with screen share and easy to work.
5310,"""Really great tool. I like the sharing options and once it's loaded, it can be very fast. It has a great reputation and I've never had to use the support. """
5311,"""It's easier for us to get in touch with our customers whenever required, fast and in a reliable way. For us it saved a lot of time instead of us travelling to customer places to check what's going on at customers end and provide a solution. Right at where i'm sitting, i'm able to gather the audience in just one single interface to save time and costs."""
5312,GoToMeeting has been a solid online meeting application. The costs really limit our amount of licenses.
5313,"""I always feel comfortable when using GoToMeeting since there are fewer technical problems, if none, mostly when the parties involved are from different locations in the world and different companies with multiple IT infrastructure. You hardly have a problem with the firewall and many local numbers are available to calling-in. """
5314,With the help of this software now I am able to work even when I am not physically present. This makes my job very easy. And I have suggested this software to many of ny clients they also seems to be liking this tool. Honestly I am very satisfied on its features. I would highly recommend this to everyone who does international business.
5315,The business problem we solve with GoToMeeting is simple: we needed a solution that any of our external clients can easily access and join meetings with our teams from any device they might have. We wanted a solution which gives us and our clients a familiar feature set along with easy to use controls so we don't need to worry about spending parts of meetings waiting for people to install complex software just to join a simple meeting.
5316,I like the idea that I GoTo Meeting can be used as a remote application that will allow me to speak to my vendors and suppliers while in different cities or countries.
5317,I feel this is a must for every business big or small.  Very convenient and user friendly.  Great audio and visual quality.  Trying to convince senior leadership to obtain a more Join a Meeting conference numbers.  This will maximize productivity and cut down on face to face meetings that tend to get lengthy and get side tracked.
5318,An awesome solution that made my online client meeting uninterrupted. Works with low bandwidth as well.  Affordable solution for all segments.
5319,"""I use GoToMeeting on a regular basis to have meetings with coworkers and colleagues and it is mostly flawless for those purposes. Meetings sometimes get delayed  due to someone having an audio or other connection issue but not often enough for it to be a big problem. One of the most valuable uses is for remote presentations. We hold conferences and judging events where the presenter is unable to be there in person so using GoToMeeting, they are able to present their PowerPoints and interact with the audience in real  time almost as seamlessly as if they were there. My biggest recommendation is to always test important meetings and presentations where time and presentation are important factors with the actual connections and computers that will be used at the time of the actual meeting.  """
5320,"""I am able to meet with my clients virtually which helps geography, illness, and winter weather not be as big of an issue. I am glad that it integrates with Acuity, another software system that I use. """
5321,"""I've used WebEx, Join.Me and GoToMeeting for work. GoToMeeting is by far the easiest and has the fewest issues when customers or myself are trying to log in. Watching back my call recordings, it's not pixelated or laggy which is amazing! It helps me provide a quality call with my customers and prospects. """
5322,"""My CEO and other HOD's always prefer to use Goto meeting to make the external meeting due to easy connect feature and external participant doesn't need to register. Also, all interview candidate, one to one external meetings are pretty flexible via Goto meeting. But for group meeting like internal including customize feature is not availale to this platform. Overall it has a significant value till now to my company to particular type of conference. I do personally use especially when I need to connect remote people where internet connection is very poor and the y can join via dialing ."""
5323,"""I am solving the business problem of training remote users without having to be in the same room.  Gotomeeting allows me to do this very well.  And, as I mentioned, it allows me to see their screen and/or their video camera while we are on the Gotomeeting.  This allows for immediate problem solving and clarification of issues."""
5324,The overall experience has been fine so far but they can improve on certain things to make it better as there are other competitors in the market.
5325,The biggest business problem we solve with GotoMeeting is handling support issues.  Very easy to show examples instead of trying to write an explanation of the issue.
5326,"""It's reliable, it allows me to share any type of file, and the device works with any type of web browser (on any device). GoToMeeting not only simplified video conferencing, it enhanced it. This was particularly true for presentations, which were often clunky because I would need to email the powerpoint file separately from the video conference call- so this centralized the whole process as a one-stop shop."""
5327,"""Well, if you want to talk to your all your staff and they are not in a location, GoToMeeting is a way to connect to all of them at the same time.  This saves energy, time and cost less.  You can connect to your friends and colleagues all at the same time and do a meeting without physically being in same place.  I really enjoy this experience using it. It is super cool."""
5328,Effective communication platform need
5329,"""I have been teaching and holding meetings online for over ten years now and I have used like eight or nine different programs through the years. Some were good, but were replaced by more popular or up to date programs. GoToMeeting, for me, has been my favorite virtual meeting tool to use. I love being able to set up all the online meetings/chats I will need for the whole month in advance and that GoToMeeting will auto generate the email invitation message with the needed hyperlinks and access codes so I can easily send out to all of my attendees/students well in advance or just a few minutes before if needed. And the transcription feature is something I especially like as do my students, so they can search through it for needed information."""
5330,GoToMeeting is one of hte easiest conferencing software packages out there. It is easy to use and just works.
5331,"""GoToMeeting It has given us a great overall experience, it is very good and it helps us at work, it is very convenient at the time of the meetings and it facilitates the work, it has helped us to finish a whole time without problems and in a professional way. We love the quality of service at the time of customer service. It really is a very good software that I recommend to everyone."""
5332,"""GoToMeeting is very useful and so easy to use for everyone. The one thing that I really like about it is that it provide the best services for the audio and the video conferences for the business meeting and this type of video quality does not provide any of its competitors. With the help of GoToMeeting software, we can easily communicate with anyone."""
5333,"""GoToMeeting has helped my team and I connect with clients and leads in all stages without having to leave our office space. The ease of use gives us the opportunity to have back to back meetings since all you have to do is click on """"start"""" and in a second you are at your next meeting."""
5334,Great with limits. There are better options out there.
5335,The support team has been great and it has helped us realize our meeting potential. Overall GTM is a great asset to our company and we do not plan to explore other options. Call quality is reliable and that is the most important thing we can ask for.
5480,"""As a coach, I did not want to limit my clients to driving distance, nor do I want to keep a dedicated office that I can bring """"strangers"""" into, outside of my home.  Zoom not only allows me to meet seamlessly but allows my clients to meet comfortably in their own home (and not have to worry about baby sitters, etc).   The ease of use and multi-platform support removes any compatibility worries when setting meetings. """
5481,"""I've been utilizing Zoom to talk and meet with my collaborators while we're isolated gathering. With the current pandemic, Zoom has become a practically day by day program that I abuse for both work gatherings and virtual meetups with companions. I truly like how you'll have various clients on straightforwardly. I'm prepared to speak with various video calls. I abuse them for chapel meeting week by week and that they are incredible."""
5482,We've used many different software programs to deliver our monthly webinar content and Zoom has proven to be the best program yet. It's ease of use and interactive functions are far beyond what we've used in the past and it allows us to successfully connect to our management teams monthly to deliver timely updates.
5483,"""We use Zoom daily for meetings with many participants. The recording feature is very helpful and, provide us with an opportunity to replicate knowledge and to record important meetings."""
5484,"""The Chatbox provides a valuable written transcript of the comments.  We also use the chatbox for Board voting so we know if there are differences of opinion that need to be discussed.   Recording is easy, so we can review the discussion or allow people who missed the meeting to view it.  We love the new Breakout Rooms, and Polls are great for maintaining interest."""
5485,We switched to Zoom recently and it has been serving very well. All our colleagues can easily meet online while they are doing their job at home.  It was really easy to implement and deploy on our environment.
5486,"""We started with free option at the beginning which allows 100 participant per meeting. The number of participants in a meeting is mostly less than 100 for our company. However, free option limits meeting period time to 40 minute. You need to restart the meeting every 40 minute. Therefore, after testing it for a week, we subscribed to Zoom. Overall, I am happy we chose Zoom for online meetings. In specific, online meeting tools becomes essential during these lockdown period and Zoom proved itself to us with its features and performance."""
5487,"""We needed a reliable audio and video conferencing platform to use for small meetings, all hands meetings, and training, among other things.  Zoom has always fit those needs perfectly.  Meetings are easy to setup, record and the quality is always top notch."""
5488,"""The quality of your meetings is much better than most videoconferencing platforms, so if it's a little less intuitive, it's probably still worth it.  And the free tier is still great as long as your meetings are 40 minutes long or less."""
5489,"""If the speaker has bad internet quality, it will be super hard to concentrate and understand what's going on in the lecture. Not sure if Zoom is capable of tuning down the video quality, for example, to compensate for the bad quality audio. It doesn't seem to be the case whenever my host got cut out. """
5490,"""I usually conduct site inspections by going to the site, but due to the limitations arisen as a result of the pandemic I have to conduct these meetings and inspections virtually. The picture quality is top-notch and there is no lag especially in video. With a good internet connection, there is literally nothing we can't do as a remote team. Previously we were deploying Zoom as a conferencing tool for only international conferencing, or limited requirements, however now we are utilizing it for all of our meetings, video conferences and audio calls on a daily basis."""
5491,"""The software has been essential to our business. We use the video and audio connection, the screen sharing, the white board, and the chat functions."""
5492,"""Our organization is able to work around the world, thanks to Zoom. We couldn't do our jobs without it. Videoconferencing isn't a perfect replacement for in-person communication, but it's a lot better than just email or text. And lots of people are using it for non-business purposes these days and experiencing the benefits of video calls to replace social engagements, or just to facilitate conversations with people who are far away. The negative press is really unfortunate, because it's not the platform's fault - but the fault of malicious people using it in unintended ways. If Zoom wasn't so successful, it wouldn't be getting attention from people with evil intentions. We'll still use Zoom long after this has blown over, and are thankful for how it enables us to work efficiently even with a distributed team."""
5493,"""Overall, Zoom Meetings & Chat has become a great way to get work done in a simple manner. Everyone is online now, and in person conferences are outdated. Whether you're working from home, remotely, or need several members in different states to jump on a conference, and watch your screen for training purposes, I would recommend it.  Overall it is pretty easy to use, but I would definitely RUN A TEST MEETING FIRST with at least one other person so you can guide colleagues accessing it for the first time.  I have used other video meetings, and Zoom has worked seamlessly for me. Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too.   I will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while."""
5494,"""Right now, my company is moving all language classes to Zoom for the foreseeable future until further notice, in order to commit to social distancing during the coronavirus crisis within the Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan regions. Although we are still within the first two weeks of transition, it has been a smooth one overall and both teachers and students (as well as company administrators) seem pleased enough in spite of the vast differences between virtual learning and in-person classes."""
5495,"""We have remote team members all over the World and we have a standup everyday. Using good video really does make the personal connection stronger and the team works better with a stronger human bond.  The Slack integration is great. On a whim, we can go from chatting to Zoom by using """"/zoom"""" in the Slack channel. This takes an issue from email, tickets, and chatting to a shared video conference where we can share screens and see what people are looking at and get resolutions faster."""
5496,"""For a period of time, I solely worked from home because I had young children. Zoom was a game changer for me! I was able to be present for staff meetings, have regular meetings with my boss(es) to discuss tasks & meet with other staff when needed to coordinate projects or train others. It was instrumental in allowing me to work from home and still stay connected to the team and on the right path with my tasks! """
5497,"""Not great. It connects and works, as long as you're not using AirPods. """
5498,"""Zoom brings so much to the table. It really is a dream come true software. People can save on travel, share their work and communicate their ideas from the comfort of their own home or office. What a great software!!!!!"""
5499,"""Overall zoom is a great tool for meetings and webinar. People can also join without host joining the call. So, you don't have to wait till host's join. It's quick and the phone app works well to. I like the UI It's simple and easy to send an invite. We used to do all meeting including international ones with zoom only and if the internet is good, I never faced and drop or lags in the call. """
5500,"""We are all able to share screens and see the same content together, at the same time. We do not have to email our spreadsheets or presentations before the meeting, constantly reminding everyone where to look or what we are discussing to stay on topic. We are able to see our team's faces for better communication, which leads to better understanding and interaction."""
5501,"""Overall my experience with Zoom has been overwhelmingly positive. Once you get over the initial bumps in the road to figure out how to best use it, it shines as a software. I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing."""
5502,"""Zoom has been a great investment for us.  We have never had software or any tool so quickly adopted by our users.  By using Zoom, we have cut costs on video conferencing and allowed ourselves to do more with less in regards to conferencing.  It has become the go to collaboration tool, and more user are doing video conferencing/screen sharing than they ever did with another tool. """
5503,I am very happy with our choice to move to Zoom. It is not very resource intensive and is more cost effective than Webex. No additional 'Firewall work' was needed to get it going on our network and the interface is clean. The web admin console is easy to use and makes managing licenses a breeze. We are able to save on the amount of licenses needed as non licensed user still has 45 minutes of meeting time. Users are normally prompted very clearly about how soon the 45min time will elapse and it helps to wrap up meetings. I highly recommend Zoom for any size organization.
5504,"""Zoom meetings are reliable, clear, and easy to use most of the time. """
5505,"""Overall our team loves it. We use it everyday, haven't had any major issues, and they constantly update their features and fix minor bug issues. """
5506,"""We use Zoom for all our internal and external conferencing requirements, so we no longer need a seperate video and call conferencing. Our overall experience in this regard has been excellent and a very positive change."""
5507,"""It just works. It's so easy to integrate with Google Calendar to schedule and send a link, and also in the paid version we use, the call recording feature is a lifesaver. Everything is made to fit most businesses needs."""
5508,"""Our organization's members are spread all over Northeast Ohio, and Zoom lets folks be face to face during a meeting, even when distance, weather, and other complications make in-person meeting impractical."""
5509,"""Overall, I really like Zoom a lot.  It's now my main software tool for business and video conferences.  It's got great video quality, and it works great on my devices.  I also like that there isn't this huge ordeal to use it's system.  It's got a great reputation, and almost all of the people I do business with know what Zoom is, and also already use it, so that makes it extremely easy on me as well! """
5510,A great solution for calls with more than 2 parties. Screen sharing is easy to use and can be passed between attendees quickly and easily. Online chat lets you post links for everyone to find/follow. Software is fast and doesn't require constant updating/downloading. Launches quickly.
5511,"""Zoom Meeting is a really good application for a new or existing user, You can dial PM for any particular person n u will be ib VC call. If you need to support remotly you can use the Zoom meeting. By using the chat option you can chat with private mode or you can broadcast your message."""
5512,"""It would be great if it could just detect and connect audio and microphone automatically, but otherwise it has all the features you'd need, it's reliable, the quality is great and we also use zoom rooms, which is the easiest way to connect to meetings in all our conference rooms. I think it's a brilliant piece of software."""
5513,"""I originally started using Zoom with a client who had a client out of state. I was really impressed with the interface and brought it into my own team. It's allowed us to expand our customer base seamlessly out of town, and drastically cut down on unnecessary travel. """
5514,"""My overall experience is excellent, except for the two comments mentioned before, everything else is perfect and works flawlessly."""
5515,"""Again, the issues I am highlighting are fairly nit picky as Zoom is vastly superior to the previous product we were using (Goto Meeting)"""
5516,"""Using Zoom was great especially for organizations that need to take HIPAA compliance into consideration. Since Zoom encrypts connections end to end, it works out great. It also was really easy to use their API, and it was very well documented. We rarely had issues with reliability through Zoom being used directly within our software. I thought it was very easy to use, and a much better option than most other video platforms. We also made great use of the reporting mechanism to know how much utilization we were getting out of Zoom. And the meetings that we generated across the organization, since we purchased an API subscription, were easy to customize for the settings on each meeting.   I do think generating meetings in Zoom is kind of inconvenient. There is a lot of information that must be copied and pasted into meeting invites and people often have questions about what link they should use. """
5517,"""Solves the problem of meeting with people outside of the office with great quality audio, video and sharing. And constantly adding new, great features!"""
5518,"""By using Zoom meetings, I am able to record for both, my audio podcasts and my video training programs by using one simple software. Prior to using Zoom, I was using two and sometimes three different platforms to accomplish the same thing I can do through Zoom!"""
5519,"""My overall experience with Zoom is extremely good. The software is lightweight but very heavy hitting. It is packed with important features, controls and abilities. I feel this software one of the best on the market for audio video conferencing.  """
5520,"""We have used Zoom for a little over a year and it has been an amazing experience.  We moved to Zoom from Webex, after people constantly having issues with that platform.  Zoom has been a night and day difference with user satisfaction sitting at a much higher rate than it was before.  """
5521,"""As I said earlier, Zoom is far superior to other tools in the market, even in its free version. We use it in our conference rooms and personal computers, with very good results in all scenarios (demos, support, remote daily meetings, etc.). Very user friendly and works really fast!"""
5522,Overall really positive experience with the software as well as the sales and support teams.
5523,"""I could not be happier. Our institution has standardized on it, and it was one of the best I.T. business decisions we have made in the last 5 years."""
5524,"""I use this product for countless meetings and I have always recommended it to co-workers. As a project manager, I often throw together meetings to have quick agile discussions with stakeholders and ZOOM allows me to do just that. Even external clients with no experience using ZOOM can access it and use it with little issue. As with all products, the more people are comfortable with the tools that ZOOM provides, the greater collaboration can be. Once people understand this, they find ZOOM to be one of the best tools for their day-to-day and begin scheduling their own web conferences. I think that alone demonstrates how useful ZOOM can be."""
5525,Zoom is a worthy competitor to GoToMeeting and Webex even if it still lacks some useful features. It does excel in large group environments and video screen participation.
5526,My overall experience has been very good and we have solidly used at least 2 other leaders in this category over the past 2-5 years.
5527,Try the demo and see if it works best for your business. I know that I don't have any regrets.
5528,"""My experience with Zoom Meetings and Chat has been great. It's quickly become one of our team's most valuable collaboration tools. It feels like a shared meeting platform that's truly collaborative. Instead of one person starting and running a meeting, we can each step in and lead on-the-fly, naturally. So far, this platform feels more like your team being in the same room together than other professional meeting platforms."""
5529,"""While we survived on the free platform for a long while at one point, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the paid version to others as the features really add a lot of robustness. Any business that hasn't caught on to video chats can try this product for free and learn what they are missing! """
5680,""" Was contacted by a sales representative shortly after filling in the contact form on their website. We had a good discussion and agreed on a couple follow-up actions for them, including for example sharing the price rates for the extended list of international dial-in numbers. Never heard of them after that, no response to my follow-up requests. Neither by e-mail, linkedin (the sales rep. had sent me a connection request), or even their contact form... Strange behaviour, would not trust.       """
5681,Disappointed. Not easy to use at all.

5688,"""Zoom has superior functionality and is super easy to use. We have been using it for years and we cannot recommend it enough. It has almost never let us down.

5690,We have a pro account with 8 paid host licenses.  We have had a billing issue since day 1 and I have been unable to get support on the issue.

They straight up lie and then have the nerve to ask me to upgrade. I really wanted to get the Pro version, but NO thank you, I can't trust liars with my credit card.             """
5696,"""So, when you try and enter a meeting, the computer app will crash 8 times. The phone app will crash at the same time. And youâ€™ll totally miss the essential meeting because Zoomâ€™s update crashed the entire computer.  Even then, the paid version is overpriced for what it is.  So thanks Zoom. Wish everyone still used Skype.             """
5697,"""My experience matches that of most people, it seems. The product is good (except for constantly changing and confusing functionality and one day of no service at a couple of weeks ago). Customer service is utterly appalling, in fact seems to be non existent. They are billing me twice every month at the moment and will not reply to emails. Their robot chat facility on their website is utterly useless. Not sure want to do. I like the product, on the whole, but donâ€™t want to go on paying double for it every month, so time to start looking elsewhere, I think. What a shame, this company should be making a massive success of this product at the moment.             """
5698,"""Great video conferencing service. Very, very poor service. Never could get phone service to set up properly and asked for a refund and to cancel. Got a reply on May 9 that they were looking into it. Never heard back. Just realized that they charged me for a second month. Using Skype or Teams for my phone service.

5699,"""This is what I wrote to PayPal and I am pretty confident I will get some of my money back.

This never happened.  I also emailed the company twice and received no response. Ultimately, I wish I would have just canceled the subscription all together, which is what I did on the day I was notified they still charged my account for two licensees. I think that transaction is fraud, but since my request was to keep one license, then I am willing to pay that amount.

5763,It's ideal for sharing resources with students. It is less appropriate for classes that need intensive explicit teaching of concepts because it lacks a convenient way to record video.
5764,"""Google Classroom works well in my classroom for students who need to be able to work independently. Students who do not have technology at home can struggle to complete all the work. Google Classroom is also a great tool when I have a substitute teacher, because I can create and monitor assignments while not in the classroom. Students can be independent and work."""
5765,"""One scenario where Google Classroom is well suited is in having students respond to a prompt at the beginning of each class. Students log into the computers, go to Google Classroom, and see the prompt posted in """"stream"""" or under """"classwork."""" Depending on the settings, students can then comment on each other's posts, enabling a sense of collaboration with the students.One scenario where Google Classroom is less appropriate is on an assignment with Google Slides. It becomes a bit wonky for students to access each time they are working on the assignment, and I have found that they frequently get lost trying to return to it."""
5766,It works great in the educational or training environment.  It may be less suites for other cooperate uses.
5767,Google Classroom is perfect for an educational environment in which multiple staff members are working with a group of students. It's also fantastic for creating assignments and making sure students are on task with their work.
5768,"""This is well suited for individualized learning, small classes, big classes, and everything in between. It is easy to use and the kids enjoy it. I appreciate that I can do discussion and assign projects to certain students and not others. I also enjoy that I am able to access all my drive documents from this one site and add them and distribute them to my students at one time."""
5769,"""Google Classroom is well suited for all modern educators because it allows us to stay current with technological advancements in the times we live in. Our students are more tech-savvy than ever, with phones and tablets persistent in the classrooms. Our students are online more often than they are offline, and to reach them, we need to get our classrooms online, which is precisely what Google Classroom does."""
5770,"""Google Classroom is well suited to a secondary school environment where the goal is to go paperless in terms of assignments, where teachers would benefit from automated organization help and where a fully functioning LMS that is integrated with an SIS is not available. This product is less suitable in a primary years environment."""
5771,Google Classroom is very user-friendly and easy to figure out.  My students are familiar with it and easily integrated when signing up.  Google Classroom does a great job of communicating new content to students via email.  It would be even more helpful if they would receive SMS messaging through Google Classroom when new content is available.
5772,Perfect for classroom use when sharing materials that all students will need.The quiz mode is great to use when trying to keep students from getting other websites during assessments.Itâ€™s great that as a teacher I can always check in on the progress of my students as they work on an assignment.

Any time where there is a need for one person to communicate with several other people is probably where google classroom could be incorporated. It's mainly designed for the classroom setting, though. It could also work if you were hosting a workshop where you wanted people to access your handouts and then turn them back in."""
5775,Google Classroom is well suited to making sure students have assigned tasks and for scheduling assignments. It is well suited for integrating a full spectrum of resources to make access easy for younger students.

5777,"""I would recommend it highly to a colleague because first, it is free. It is very easy to set-up and extremely useful for teachers. Students in the classroom can also reply to other student's posts. Plus it also gives you quick access to other Google apps like Docs and Slides to view students' work."""
5778,Google Classroom is wells suited for beginners and new learners. It is highly suited for people who have recently joined their jobs and undergoing special workshops. It will help them knowing everyone in the group and will lead to a better understanding of thing and rules which are implemented in the organization.

I really like that you can create exams quickly in Google Classroom."""
5780,"""As a technology integrator that serves two elementary schools, I have seen Google Classroom used in grades K-5. While many teachers use the platform for a variety of tasks, the best use case I've seen is to use it for writing instruction and project creation. In writing, the teacher has instant access to students' work which allows the teacher a quicker response time for leaving comments/feedback within Google Docs which helps guide student writing during the process of writing, not just as a final product analysis. In project creation, teachers can create one template (for example a Google Slides template with a topic on each slide) and share it so that each student gets their own template to customize. From there, the teacher has instant access for comments/feedback. For younger students, Google Classroom is great for sharing links and basic content creation, but students may find it a bit more challenging to access if they have to enter district-created Google logins."""
5781,"""I use Google Classroom for all of the classes I teach at my high school. I'm in a computer lab, but Google Classroom could also be used for teachers who do not have computers for students to use in class. It allows me to post announcements, assignments, worksheets, online resources, quizzes, and pretty much anything class-related in an easy-to-use interface. However, it currently does not include a very detailed gradebook. I have to keep separate spreadsheets with my students' grades in order to use weighted categories."""
5782,"""As stated before, Google Classroom would be well suited for an instructor that wants students to have access to a large portion of information related to the class. It may be less appropriate to use as a school-wide site."""
5783,"""Google classroom is well suited for a 3rd grade and up classroom. It is especially well suited for middle and high school where students are more well-versed in using technology. It allows teachers to easily share assignments with students and grade those assignments quickly and without paper. It might not be as useful in classrooms that do not have 1:1 technology, as it would be harder for students to finish assignments on time."""
5784,"""Google Classroom is suitable for any classroom setting from grades 3 to the collegiate level. Students are easily and quickly engaged and can maintain communication with teachers beyond normal teaching hours. Students can submit their work and receive grades directly on the site, and they are able to share resources with others for group projects or other collaborative settings."""
5785,"""I believe Google Classroom is well-suited for any classroom in education. It is great for posting announcements, assignments, and class material. It is also a great method of online learning when an in-class session is not possible (snow days, homework to be completed at home, etc.) It would be less appropriate in scenarios outside of education, although the means of communication are easy."""
5786,"""Google Classroom is best suited to a fixed group of users where everyone is a managed Google user within a G-Suite environment. We have an often transient group of learners, some of whom are not within our managed network of Google users. Therefore, our situation may not be ideal."""
5787,"""For classroom teachers, it is ACES. Even if an instructor is using it just as a repository for student work it's fantastic. Google Classroom can aid you in becoming a paperless classroom or just reducing some of the copies that you are making. If YouTube is blocked in your school, you can post links for students to view at home (or on their phones). Google classroom can help high school or college level teachers keep their learning environments ORGANIZED."""

5814,"""All in all, GoToMeeting is a promising remote meeting software due to its limitless features and functionalities.  It is a good software for attending the webinars and conducting online tutorials and teaching.  As a teacher using it, this is so far one of the best pieces of software I've used because the video and audio are clear enough that all attendees understand easily."""
5815,"""On-demand or scheduled meetings where participants need to screen share and collaborate, showing design files, project plans, reports, etc.Video conferencing, including use in job interviews, team meetings, and client presentations."""
5816,"""In some instances, GoToMeeting is harder to use than alternatives such as Zoom or BlueJeans in terms of video experience and in some instances is more complex than using Skype for example. At times the mobile app is inflexible when trying to switch from mobile to an internet connection in particular when entering the pin code, which is very tricky when on the move."""
5817,"""If adopted by an entire department or user group, it works well as support, and training for the entire group is efficient.  If you have meetings with a mixture of technologies joining the meeting (phone, computer audio with video, computer with phone) GoToMeeting bridges seamlessly.  Video quality is excellent, users are very impressed with the jump up in quality form free platforms (Skype, Google Chat, etc)."""
5818,"""GoToMeeting is suitable for users that want the option to meet with clients or customers without having to meet in person. As a large software company, we aren't in the same city, let alone the same state as most of our customers so it's important for us to have a platform that can allow for more personalized, one on one meetings. If you are working locally and often want to meet with clients in person, this software is not a good fit. There wouldn't be a purpose to it."""
5819,"""My main issue with GoToMeeting is the lack of reliability. A lot of their features are really nice, especially on the recording side. The problem is that none of those features matter if the core of the product, the meeting itself, is having issues. If my audio is delayed by a couple of seconds it leads to a lot of awkward silences and people accidentally interrupting each other. When I'm setting up a meeting in a conference room, I should just be able to come in and click a button to get going."""
5820,"""GoToMeeting is a great option for having to meet with clients or to show them your screen. Since end-users are not forced to download a client and can join from any web browser, it works well for inviting customers in secure locations or who don't have the rights to download applications to their computer. It does an alright job for supporting customers, but there are better options to control the customer's computer from afar."""
5821,"""I highly recommend GoToMeeting. It's a great tool for meetings, webinars, training, etc. I think it's great that people in different locations can still collaborate and hold meetings, whether just audio with slides, or face-time like meetings. Given the current events with COVID-19, it's especially important to be able to have these interactions without actually coming into contact with someone."""
5822,"""GoToMeeting is well suited if you need to record a screen-share session or collaboration/conversation, to connect people in multiple geographic locations, to do video conferencing for business meetings, and to share documents when doing any collaboration. You also have a change window to share additional comments. It allows large meetings to occur across different rooms if required."""
5823,"""I think GoToMeeting is perfectly suited for large teams that need to be able to have a consistent forum to offer to clients to connect. With the flexibility to record and screen-share, it makes life so much easier for CS teams that work with clients on a regular daily basis. It is the perfect easy-to-use solution to connect with clients and be able to provide a robust experience to your audience outside of a regular phone call."""
5824,"""GoToMeeting is, in my experience, best used when we have to share our work with someone else. We can easily share our screen to show how the work is being done, or if we need to know anything, we can let anyone in the conference be a presenter and play his part."""
5825,"""I can't think of many scenarios where it would be inappropriate. I have used it for board meetings, end-user training sessions, recordings so future staff can reference it for learning, and I'm sure I'm missing others. On the fly, meetings are pretty simple, so you can share screens and troubleshoot problems."""
5826,"""GoToMeeting is a great tool.  It can also be suitable for meetings with partners or customers that you are trying to show your products or walk through a contract or proposal.  Not sure it's beneficial for just a conference call, especially with how cell phones can accommodate multiple people these days, but if you need to see the same thing or each other, this is perfect."""
5827,"""GoToMeeting is well suited for growing companies that need a tool to showcase their software platform. Whether it's inside sales, outside sales, or customer success, it's a quality product to use. Also for those logging in its web-based capabilities are great for clients on the go. Overall great sales product. I can't speak to how it's used by operations as much, I would assume for group meetings."""
5828,GoToMeeting is terrific software for remote meetings or presentations.
5829,"""It definitely gets the job done, but honestly our clients aren't big fans of GTM due to how agressively GTM pushes people to download the application instead of just using a web browser version. Our internal team likes it and has found it easy to hop into rooms and talk with one another about projects."""
5830,My organization really likes GoToMeeting. Our sales team gives a lot of sales presentations through the software and they comment on how 99% of the companies they are presenting to are already familiar with the look and feel of GoToMeeting. We have found the app to work really well on mobile as well.
5831,"""GoToMeeting offers flexibility in video conferencing, where each person can share their work and take control of the presentation. It offers good functionality for collaboration on projects that require several individuals to handle different pieces of the project and then come together, share their work and make modifications in the moment."""
5832,"""GoToMeeting is well suited to anyone needing to use collaboration between companies, companies and vendors, companies and customers, etc.  This really is meant for B2B type setups, technical training, quarterly meetings, etc. I do not recommend this as a replacement for an in-house instant messaging/collaboration platform (Skype for Business or Slack). Even with AD integration, the product doesn't stack up against the other two. I like the fact that the product sticks to what it's good at and doesn't try to be everything to everyone."""
5833,"""When the need is to see others' screens or show your screen, GoToMeeting is perfectly suited. Screenshots and walkthroughs are just not enough, being able to show exactly what is happening is the real need that GoToMeeting fulfills. That's where GoToMeeting shines.When just doing a conference call without a screen-share, it's not as appropriate, as most people would need to download the application to use it."""
5834,"""GoTo meeting was well suited for screen sharing and audio conversation.  The video chat issue was really a problem.  If too many of us in the office would try to show our faces on screen during the same meeting, it would severely lag and we would have issues seeing each other."""
5835,"""GoToMeeting gives users the ability to bring people together from anywhere into a single environment. By being able to screen share and pass off presenter responsibilities, it has the potential to be very interactive and productive. Sometimes, more productive than actually being in the same room at the same time."""
5836,"""Finalizing project details is where GoToMeeting really shines and is the most beneficial for our usage. Allowing us to have frequent meetings, putting them together (even at the last minute) and working out details between ourselves and a client is a huge time saver. Where it isn't as useful (and this isn't a """"flaw"""" of GoToMeeting but when working to land a new client, in person meetings tend to show a higher rate of securing the project than online meetings. Once that personal link is established then GoToMeeting is great."""
5837,"""I like GoToMeeting for video conferencing and conference calls.  I like it for screen sharing as well, but not necessarily collaboration.  I think it works really well within an organization with multiple offices or job sites and if set-up well, video conferencing in these instances is particularly easy.  Getting video conferencing from external users has been a challenge, and most just call in, even though there are digital audio and video obviously available.  This may be a simple end-user preference on their end, however.  We just really find that internal meetings where we can look face to face with folks in another location make working together much more smooth. """
5838,"""GoToMeeting is great if you have a large team, and youâ€™re always needing to be in touch. If you donâ€™t speak to clients on a daily basis, either thatâ€™s biweekly or monthly, then GoToMeeting sounds too expensive. If you do not need to use such a quality service, then chances are you will find a more affordable outlet online. """
5964,"""Although Zoom provides a quality product, and I would normally give a higher rating than I did, Zoom lacks in billing and customer support. Zoom has focused on the onslaught of its privacy issues and has diverted its attention to this issue. In doing so, users that have issues with subscriptions are left fending for themselves. Billing and customer support are lacking, and users are faced with emails that go unanswered. When attempting to call in, long waits of being placed on-hold occur, only to be answered by their answering service. With the recent onslaught of online needs, the business practices of Zoom have failed. Numerous accounts of someone having paid for a business or pro account has ended up reverting down to a basic subscription. This reversion results in numerous problems, one of which is the inability to hold meetings longer than 40 minutes."""
5965,"""For now, due to its tools, it has been the best for video conferences and calls."""
5966,"""Very good for sales, marketing, and onboarding/training calls with screen shares where you need reliability and ease of use and to keep a recording of the session. Less suited for product demos which will be disseminated by email, it is not a hosting/editing tool."""
5967,"""Zoom is a platform that is very useful when there are employees who work remotely.I consider that it is always appropriate to have a platform like this, because it is compatible with all devices, so you can connect from anywhere."""
5968,Easy-to-use platform for online meetings and distance learning especially for higher education institutions. It allows our school to deliver the academic education to our students in this critical time. Zoom provides high quality audio and video compared to other software product. Sharing presentations and recordings is very easy as well.
5969,This is perfect for teaching my high schoolers online.  It also works well for faculty meetings.  I'm quite pleased with it.  I wish there was a way of taking roll that would show me when someone leaves the group.
5970,"""Zoom is well suited for companies and organizations that need to meet with clients or coworkers on a consistent basis. In particular, a great feature of Zoom is if you have a very large group, you can break the group into smaller teams to have mini conversations and then bring back the entire group. It is less appropriate if you just need to do some video conferencing for fun.  Zoom is also great if someone can't make a meeting because you can record your call. """
5971,Zoom is perfect for a one-on-one discussion with individuals who work remotely. It allows you to see someone face-to-face in a meeting without the expense of flying or driving for the meeting. It allows for visual interaction and display of information in a way that is very simple and easy.
5972,"""Zoom is well suited for group meetings and group work. Also for one-to-one meetings with team members or relevant stakeholders. It's also useful if you don't want to share your phone number to chat for example via WhatsApp, the meeting can take place via Zoom with just email/meeting ID, etc."""
5973,"""Zoom is the most suitable when yours is a SaaS business and you have clients all over the world. Instead of wasting time and money on having face to face meetings, it is much better if you have high-quality video calls. But, if you want to create personal relationships, of course, don't compromise meeting your client in person."""
5974,"""Zoom is well suited if you want to work from home and stay in touch with colleagues, or if you want to communicate with friends all over the world.Zoom is less appropriate to use when a lot of participants wants to join the meeting, sometimes the app can crash or stop the meeting but this has only happened once before."""
5975,I think Zoom provides a lot of flexibility and it is reasonably priced.  I think it is good for doing online presentations both as the person presenting and the person(s) watching.  The features of asking survey questions and breakout rooms are very helpful if you are using it for online instruction.
5976,Very well suited when a single person is speaking at a time. Very well suited for when you need to discuss something that requires visual feedback. Great for feeling connected to others when working together remotely. Completely unusable for a choir with multiple people trying to sing from multiple remote locations.
5977,I have had the opportunity to use Zoom both at work and in graduate school.  Zoom was a great tool to use to meet with my classmates when we were working on group projects. To be able to have those conversations in real time was very beneficial.  It has also proven very helpful to bring training into our school district.  It has allowed us to decrease expenses to bring in trainers to implement new programs.
5978,Zoom is great for scheduling meetings through Google Chrome! Love the integration there. The app screen shares well and I've had very little problems with using Zoom. Having the meeting link in the Google Calendar app is a Godsend! I've had a few wires crossed while using the app in which I needed to generate new meeting links.
5979,"""Zoom is a great tool for holding important meetings. Not everyone can always be present at the company so it helped us a lot. There are some institutions that we are still unable to make clear by video calls, requiring human contact for a better understanding and explanation of work things."""
5980,"""Zoom is very important for sales.  Sales are personal, you have to gain trust from your prospect to be a successful salesperson.  Being able to see the person you are presenting to allows you to build immediate rapport.  You both become real people and there's now a human element to this conversation over technology.  You can also see if your prospect is engaged or bored- much easier to pick up on buying signs by being able to see your connection."""
5981,"""I would 100% recommend Zoom if they need a conference platform or a platform for clients where they will need to record their calls. But due to all the fuss of the software, sometimes it's easier to just use Skype."""
5982,"""Whenever we have to carry out follow-up meetings with clients, we try to do it through Zoom, thanks to its reliability and ease of use. Share screen, show graphics, etc. It is very simple with this tool."""
5983,Zoom makes it easy to generate meetings and send them to parties.
5984,We used Zoom for conferencing with our teams while working on outages or maintenance windows.
5985,"""Zoom is well suited for organizations that vary in all different sizes, easily providing streamlined meeting capabilities for users at any level. It's easier to imagine many different scenarios where Zoom would work great, rather than situations where it would not be appropriate. That being said, Zoom is best suited for organizations that appreciate video capabilities for their meetings."""
5986,Zoom is well suited in cloud video meetings.  Far better experience that current competitors. Zoom makes it easy to start/join a meeting from any device.
